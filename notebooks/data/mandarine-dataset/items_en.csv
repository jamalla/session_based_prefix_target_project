790,en,The nuts and bolts of VLOOKUP,101.0,"The previous video showed you oneway to use the VLOOKUP function.Now let's break thatexample down and see how it works.VLOOKUP uses fourarguments, or pieces of data.The first argument is calledthe Look up value, and it's the data you know; if I were using a phone book, the Look up value would be someone's name.In this example thoughthe Look up values are part numbers, and I'm using a cell reference as a placeholder for those part numbers.If you wanted to,could also enter the valuesdirectly in the formula; like so.But as a rule it's easierto enter values in cells thanin formulas, sothat's what I did here.The next argument is the blockof values that you want to search.Excel calls this the Tablearray, or the Look up table,and our example usescells B3 through E52.You can use any cell rangethat you think will return the data you need to find, butyou need to remember a gotcha.The Look up values, the datayou know, have to be in the left hand column of yourLook up table; your cell range.You can have data to theleft of your Look up values, but VLOOKUP won't search there.The next argument, thenumber 3, is a column reference;it tells VLOOKUP where youexpect to find the data you want to see.We're using column D; thethird column over from the Look up values, so I entered 3.And this also points toanother gotcha: your data has to be arranged in columns vertically.Just remember that the Vin VLOOKUP stands for""vertical"", and columns are vertical.The last argument iscalled the Range look up, and it tells the function that Iwant an exact match, or a partial match, to my look up value.I'm using False to give meexact matches; I entered a part number; I got a price.But sometimes you onlywant a partial match.For example, this Exceltable calculates discounts, andit assumes customers don't want tobuy exactly 10 or 100 of anything.In other words, I don'twant to limit them to findingmatches to just thevalues in this column.So I enter the number of itemspurchased, and I get a discount of 9%.If you look at the arguments for the function, you cansee it uses True instead of False.That lets me enter quantities that don't match the values listed in the table. So another gotcha to remember: False returns exact matches;True returns partial matches.Also if you want to use True youcan just leave the argument blank.So that's how VLOOKUPworks, and next I'll show you howto use it to find dataon a different worksheet.",2016,Advanced,"['Financial', 'Marketing']",['Excel'],['Produce'],185.0,tutorial
791,en,Look up values on a different worksheet,69.0,"If you need to, you canlook up values on more than oneworksheet in a workbook.As an example, we downloaded some web site data from a database, and the first sheet has page numbers for the site pages, and the hits on each page.The second sheet also has thepage numbers, plus the page names.VLOOKUP can help meaggregate this data so I can seepage IDs, names andhits in one place.I'll start here on the pagestab because it gives me twoof the function's arguments.First, I see the page names arelisted in column B, the second column over.This is what I want VLOOKUP to find, the answers I wantto see, so my columnreference argument is 2.Also, I know I want to find the pagename that matches a given page number.That data starts in CellA2 an ends in cell B39,so A2 to B39 is mylook up table argument.Now I'll go to the pageviews tab, enter a couple of headings, and my function, =VLOOKUP,open parentheses, and F2 is my look up value because that's where I'll enter the page IDs.Next I enter pages, thename of the other tab, an exclamation point,then my look up table, a comma, and my column reference.In other words, thelook-up table argument is now the name of the worksheet, theexclamation point, and the range of cells I want to search.Because I need exactmatches, I'll enter False as my range look up argument,press Enter to finish the formula; and you can see Iget an error message becausethe formula wants a value in cell F2.So I'll copy a page ID here,paste it, and now I know how many hits NationalPage News 2 received; and to do this again, press Escapeto clear the marquee, copy another page number, paste it;and you'll see another page name.So next, I'll show youhow to use absolute cellreferences in VLOOKUP formulas; they are how you copythe formula down a column.",2016,Advanced,"['Financial', 'Marketing']",['Excel'],['Produce'],159.0,tutorial
792,en,Copy a VLOOKUP formula,85.0,"Whenever you need to copya VLOOKUP formula, or anyother formula, you have touse absolute cell references.For example, it would benice to list all the page namesnext to their page numbersand hit data, instead of justlooking them up one at a time.To do that, we will need tocopy the formula down this column.Whenever you copy a formulayou have to use absolute cellreferences, and you do that byadding dollar signs to your arguments.So I'll demonstrate byadding a heading, and then I'll start the formula. but this time, instead of entering a blank cell as my first argument,my look-up value, I'll enter $A4.The dollar sign is what makesit an absolute cell reference.In this case it forces VLOOKUPto use just the values in column A.I'm using those because Iknow I want to match each pagenumber with its pagename, so I'll use those valuesdirectly instead of theempty placeholder cells you'veseen in the previous videos.Next I enter the name ofthe other worksheet, an exclamation point, then in my cell range, I also use two more dollar signs in front of the A and the B, like so.I'll enter the same columnreference argument: 2, and False is my range look up argument, again because I want exact matches.Press Enter, and theformula returns Home page.Now grab the fill handle;drag it down the column;and there you go: allthe data, easy to scan.One thing to rememberthough: I only used dollar signs infront of the column letters.If I separate column lettersand row numbers with dollar signs, like this, VLOOKUP only returns one value: the first one. That happens because dollar signs prevent Excelfrom changing column and row values in a formula when you copy that formula.Now here's something that can help: if you're having trouble adding dollar signsto a formula, put your cursorin an argument and press F4; as you press the button it inserts dollar signs in eachallowable place in the argument.In other words, it won't letyou put one in the wrong place.Just press F4 until thedollar sign is in the right placeand go on to your next argument.So that's a final gotcha,and while we're talking about them, let's recap theother possible mistakes: your look up table has to be tothe right of your look upvalues, or on another worksheet.You have to arrangeyour data in columns,and you enter False whenyou want an exact match, andTrue, or nothing, ifyou want a partial match.Finally, if you're going tocopy the formula, make sureyou put the dollarsigns in the right places.",2016,Advanced,"['Financial', 'Marketing']",['Excel'],['Produce'],207.0,tutorial

Press Enter.Now when you autofill the cell,all the formulas point to D20.Now we can change the percentage tocalculate a different buffer amount.The last thing we will dois add an Estimated cost column, that uses a function.With G6 selected, click Auto-sum.Excel automatically assumes we want to add the three columns to the left, so press Enter, and then autofill the formula to the other cells.In this course you've learned the basicsof creating your first Excel workbook.",2016,Beginner,"['Financial', 'Marketing']",['Excel'],['Produce'],246.0,tutorial

Custom is great because you can plug in values.There's a thing called RGBcolors and they have a number value; if you get those fromyour designer, you can plug those in and get the exact color,let's say for your company colors.You can put that in your PowerPoint.But there's also a shortcut for thatand this is new in PowerPoint 2013.Let me go over here to Color and go down to this Eyedropper tool and click that and then move our… Now the very tip of thiseyedropper, if you put it on a color -or if you rest there it shows you the RGB colors - but if you click it, there you go it turns the background that color right from that image.A couple of things with thecolor: 1, don't be afraid to use white-black, I mean this is your background.This shouldn't be, you know, the star is the foreground of your presentation. Also if you use a strong color,it's going to limit the color palette, I mean think about those PowerPoints we've seen where you've had those blue,dark blue backgrounds they putblack text on, it's really hard to read.Also if you're going to bein an auditorium, someplace dark where the audience isdark, make sure you use a dark or black background. OK, let's go on and show Gradient fill; click that and you can seeit kind of blends light and color.In fact the tot part here iswhite and the color comes in at the bottom corner. Now if you look over the menu,there's tons of different ways you canfiddle with this as much as you want.I'll just show you a presetor two; if I click this one,now the light is at thebottom and the corners are dark.Finally we're going to show a texture fill and go down here to this box, thislittle box here that says Textureand shows you some premade ones.There's some marble, there's cloth, there's some other things you can use, this is a paper bag I kind of like.You click on that.  Now one thing with a strong background is, you can see it's hardto read text on that, so you can lighten that up withthis Transparency tool.It's a bar, you just clickon it and move it to get the lightness that you wanted.You can see what you want, andthen unclick and there you have it.If you like this for the background, any time that you like the background, you just go down here to Apply to all and you can click thatand it applies that backgroundto all of the slides.",2016,Intermediate,"['Communication', 'Marketing']",['PowerPoint'],['Produce'],200.0,tutorial

Let's go over here to View and click Slide master and now again the left-hand side is no longer your presentation,it's all of the slide masters.You could pick the top oneand put something there but that would - anything you puthere will be an all of your slides.I don't think you need yourlogo on all your slides, just maybe a few of them, unlessyou're doing something for security.So I'm going to pick this slidehere, I'm going to put something here.Now if you're doingsomething small, you'd just insert it like a regular picture, it's not background just a little watermark so let's say a logo.So, Insert, Pictures, youcan grab them from online, I'm going to grab them from my desktop here and I'll grab the logo and I can drag this around to where I want it, I just click the outsideand I can pull it down.There's some guides that popup that kind of guide you inand tell you whenyou're level with things.I'm going to put it rightthere and this will appearanytime I'd choose thisslide in my presentation.I'll show you that in justa moment, but since I'm herelet's just add a picturebut we're going to add a background picture thewhole width, so to do that, what we want to do is rightclick on the blank part of the slide, Format background.We'll come back over hereto Picture or Texture fill,except this time we'regoing to choose a picture under File and I'm going to choose this picture - might be something for a, let's saya first slide for a jumping off event or maybe this is a slide we use a lot in our advertising we want to use.Now it's a pretty strongpicture with a lot of colors, so again this is the backgroundwe want to drop it down, it's the foreground that's important.So I click this transparency bar andmove that down quite a ways actually.Just so it's subtly there.OK. And when I'm done, go upto Close master view in the ribbon and now I'm back to my presentation and here I'm going to add a new slide, andhere's this new slide I just made.So I can choose that one anytime Iwant the background with the logo.Now there's another ways touse pictures that I think is a little bit - for me, it's a lot more fun, but I think it's a vibrant way of doing it.Let me show you that.I'm going to justinsert a regular picture.Let me get a new slidehere, a new blank slide and then I'm going to insert a picture.I'm going to choose the same picture.I'm going to changea few things here.I'm going to close theFormat menu here by clicking the box and then down here onthe bottom right-hand corner,that's the zoom, that'sit's not controlling the slidesit's controlling the workspace. And what I want to do is I want to make this smaller. Now the large white box, that's the slide itself with the picture, you can see what it's going to look likehere in the thumbnail on the left-hand side, so kind of watch both spaces, but what I want to do here is I want to take this picture and I'm going to use anelement of the picture.One of the things, thatwe have these big beautifulpictures now and if you havesomething that has a lot ofa quality to it you can blow itup and it still looks really nice.So you can kind of see whatI'm doing here, I just wantto grab an element of this picture, just kind of the steps, the kind of theaction of the picture.And it has a nice bignegative space here, the cement.That's a great place to put text.So let's do that.

PowerPoint will essentially work the same as it always has, but in Compatibility Mode you'll miss out on a few new features like for example, if I switch over to a .pptx file, I have lots of choices for slidetransitions, like this one - Vortex,but if I go back to the .ppt file in Compatibility Mode I don't have as many transitions to choose from and I certainly don't have Vortex.So if you don't need to openthe file in PowerPoint 2003,the best thing to do isconvert it to the new .pptx format and here's how to do that.Click the File tab to goto the backstage, click Infothen click Convert.We get the Save as dialog box asking where we want to save the converted file. Click Save to save it in the same folder as the old file.Now we have two files, one with a .ppt extension that is compatible with PowerPoint 2003 and one with the. pptxextension that is formatted for the new version of PowerPoint.Let's leave the older file and continue working on the .pptx file and see now we have more transitions and most importantly Vortex.We'll get into Compatibility Modein more detail in the final video.So, you're well on your wayto making the switch to the new version of PowerPoint, nowstick around and we'll do more.",2016,Beginner,"['Communication', 'Marketing']",['PowerPoint'],['Discover'],258.0,tutorial

Select the one you like and then choose a variant if you want.The Design tab also hascommands for working with Slide size and the background.The Transitions tab is great, weshowed this to you earlier as well.This is where you go to addtransition effects in between slides.Choose a transition but remember to look over here on the right too, you have Effect options, theApply to all button and other features to refineyour transitions even further.So if the Transitions tab isfor animated effects between slides, then the Animations tab is where you add animations to things on a slide like text, shapes, charts and so on. Select what you want to animateand choose an animationand again remember to lookon the right, you can chooseEffect options tofurther customize the effect.You might be asking yourself,where's the custom animation task pane?Well open theAnimation pane and you'll see.This pane shows theanimation timeline and if you're looking for Effect andtiming options, click this arrow.The Slide show tab is allabout the big moment, actually presenting your slides to people.This is where you start the show either from the beginning or from the current slide.If you're used to startingthe show on PowerPoint 2003using a button down here,you can still use that buttonbut now it's moved over here.The next tab, the Reviewtab, is not to be overlooked.This is where you go tocheck spelling, insert commentsand where you can compare yourcurrent presentation with another one.And the last but not least tab, View.This is the place for things that were on the old View menu, Slides sorter view,the Ruler, Grid lines and Guides.

There are these paths and down at the very bottom there's a link to more.A Straight Line path is most common and that's what I want so I'll choose it. The Path effect plays in the auto preview and it's a downward path by default.On the path, the greencircle shows the starting point for the line, the red circle shows the ending point.This paler image of the wheelshows you where it will end up.When you see the ghosted image and the start and end points are little circles,you know the path is selected.When I click anywhere that isn'ton the path that deselects the path.When the path isn't selected, the starting and ending points are a greenarrow and a red arrow.For my wheel animation effect I wanta right pointing path not a down one.The easiest way to fix thatis to first select the Path,point to it and look forthe 4 pointed cursor, then click, then I'll open Effect Options and here are more types of straight paths.I'll choose Right, thewheel now moves to the rightand its arrows point to the right.I want to make this pathlonger so I'm going to resize it.First I select it, then I'm going to press the Shift key to keep the line horizontal as I drag it.With the Shift key down, I point to the end of the pathand when I see this 2 pointedsizing cursor I drag the mouse.I want the wheel to stop about here so I'll let up the mouse button and Shift key.Now let's preview the effect, the path moves the wheel straight to the right to the end of the bar.dragging to size the path, I can move it in any direction I want too.Earlier I could have changedits direction by dragging it from down to right.

Now the roll looks more natural and the wheel doesn't spin in place.Last I want the wheel toroll back and forth, so I'm going to select both effects. I'll click one, press control and click the other.With both effects selected, there's just one arrow toclick for the drop down menu and whatI select will apply to both effects.I'll click Effect options and select this option, Auto reverse. This will make both effects play and then play again in reverse.Now while I've got thedialog box open, I'm going toclick the Timing tab and speedup the duration of both effects.I'll change this from 2 seconds to 1.5. Another thing I can do ismake the whole effect repeatby clicking 2 in the repeat box.There's the finished effect, the wheel rolls back and forth and it repeats.Here's another animationsequence that uses combined effects.This rocket moves on twodiagonal motion paths, one to the Moon and one back to Earth.I'll play the sequence.The rocket flies to the Moonthen turns around and flies back.You'll also notice that the rocket gets smaller as it moves away and larger as it returns.That's the work of aneffect called grow/shrink.It's combined with the motion paths.Here are the effectsin the animation pane.These are the motion pathsand each one is followed bythis emphasis effectcalled grow/shrink.Each grow/shrink effect is set toplay with the previous motion path.So let's look at the firstuse of the grow/shrink effect.I'll open its effect options.In this case the grow/shrinkeffect applies to the rocketas it moves away, so itssize is set to smaller which makes the rocket shrink; also its smooth start setting delays the shrinking so it happens away down the path or farther away and the smooth end setting helps the shrinking effect at the end of the path to occur gradually.Now here's the othergrow/shrink effect.Let's open its effect options.This effect applies to therocket on its return motion path, so the rocketsize is doubled at 200% and its smooth start and smoothend settings are adjusted tomake the rocket get largergradually as it returns on the motion path.So, with motion paths, remember there's power in combinations.",2016,Advanced,"['Communication', 'Marketing']",['PowerPoint'],['Produce'],289.0,tutorial

I'm going to recreate it now to show you more techniques for using motion paths and animation.Here's the list withno animations applied.For this exercise, I've zoomed in for a close up view and I'll turn off Auto Preview.First I'll apply the motion paths.The paths go on this chevron arrow; for the first path, I select the arrow, open theAnimation Gallery and choose Lines. A down path is applied and that's what I want.The pale image of the chevron arrow shows me where the arrow will move to, but I want it to stop at the second bullet, so I need to shorten the path.I press Shift to keep theline vertical as I redraw it,then point to the end, look for the two headed arrow and drag the end upward.As I drag, note thiscrosshairs that appears.It helps me visually to line upthe end of the path with the bullet.I release the mouse andShift key and click away.There's the first path.Let's preview it. The arrow stops at the second bullet.I need three more motionpaths for the chevron arrow.For the next one, I select the arrow again and this time I click Add Animation sincethe arrow already has one path.In that gallery, I choose Lines again.The second path is applied and it'sthe one that's currently selected.Remember that the selectedpath always has red and green circles rather than arrows at the start and end.I need to resize this new path to gobetween the second and third bullets.I press Shift to keep the line vertical, then I point to the green circle at the start of the path, look for the two headed arrow cursor and drag the starting point to the second bullet.I let up the mouse and Shift key.The starting point forthe second path is now here.The end point needs tobe at the third bullet.The path is still selectedso I press Shift and drag upthe end of the pathto the third bullet.I now have two motionpaths for the chevron arrow.Let's preview how this plays.The arrow moves down in two steps tothe second bullet and third bullet.That's exactly what I want.So to add more paths, I select the chevron, use Add Animation to apply the path and then resize the path.Now the animation pane can helpwith this process, so let's open it.Here are the motionpaths I've added so far.Notice how when I selectthe first path effect in the pane, that path is alsoselected on the slide.I select the second path effect in the pane and it's selected on the slideand there's the third path.Another detail is that forthe paths that start below the chevron, they're shown with a pale image of the chevron at the start and end.So, as I'm resizing these layered paths, I can select themin the animation pane if I want to.Now I've got all themotion paths in place.Before I preview them, I wantto adjust their playing time.A quick way is to select them all.I'll click the bottom one, press Shift and click the top one to select the range, then I'll change the duration setting up here.Instead of two secondsI'll decrease this to .75. Notice how the durationbox that's in the Animation pane shorten as I decrease the number.To watch the sequence,I'll click Play selected.The arrow moves downand stops at each bullet.I'll complete the animationsequence by adding a text effect.I want the effect to turnthis text from gray to white.I'll select the placeholderand in the Animation Gallery, I'll choose an Emphasis effect called the Brush Color.Now I'll open EffectOptions for the group.I want the effect to turn the text white, so I'll change this blue color to white.Also I want to animate the text by word instead of letter, so I'll choose By word.To see just the texteffect, I'll click Play Selected;the text highlights line by line.My last task is to reorder the motion paths so they play between the text effects.I'll select the first motion path and drag it down underthe first text line which is ""Location"". Then I'll do that with the rest of the paths in order, so the second one goes under ""Time"".The third one goes under ""Dress code"" and the fourth one follows ""What to bring"".Another thing is, I want the text effects to play automatically after each path, so I'll press Ctrl and click to select each text effect that follows a path.I'll set these to Start after previous.

This slide contains four objects, text, a picture, a chart and a shapeand each one has a differenttype of animation assigned to it.Press Shift-F5 to play theslide show from the current slide.I built the slide so that each timeI click a different animation plays.First the text, thisanimation is called Fly in and I have it set so that each time Iclick a line of text flies in.The picture has the Fadeanimation attached to it.The chart uses the Wipeanimation, each time I click some bars wipe on which makes it appear as though the bars are growing or drawing on and on the shape I applied the Fill color animation which changes theFill colors slowly from blue to orange.So as you can see, aPowerPoint animation is nothing morethan something changing on a slide.It can be motion, a fade, a wipe, colors or a combination.Now let's take a closerlook at those animations.Here's the same slidewith the animations removed.To add an animation, youfirst select what you want to animate, choose an animation andthen modify it with effect options.Click the text, then go to the Animations tab, open the Animations gallery and select one.You can keep tryinganimations until you find one you like.Notice that every time youselect one, you see a preview.That's the defaultworkflow for creating animations.You make a change then see apreview, make another change, see a preview. You can click here and turn off Auto preview if you want.Then you can click this buttonto Preview animations manually.If you don't find exactly what you're looking for, choose an animation that's closeand then check out the Effect options available for the animation.In the case of Fly in, youcan choose a direction and then choose the sequence thatyou want to bring in the text.As one object or All atonce brings the entire block of text in at once or you canbring the text in by paragraph.Again you can animateanything in three steps.Select the picture, selectan animation, this time let's choose Shape and tweak it with an effect option.For shape you can choose a shapeand direction.Select the chart, choose an animationand choose an effect option.Let's bring the chartelements in by series.Select the shape, choose an animationthen choose an effect option.In this case wechoose a color to fade to.One more thing, if you everwant to remove an animation,just select the object thathas the animation applied to it and then click None.With animations you can getas complex as you want or you can keep it simple.",2016,Beginner,"['Communication', 'Marketing']",['PowerPoint'],['Produce'],242.0,tutorial

Now we can add animation to the title to give it more impact.Select the title, then go to theAnimations tab and open the gallery.Animations are dividedinto four categories; Entrance animations bring an objectinto view on the slide, Exit animations take an objectout of view on the slide and Emphasis animations add something toan object that's already on the slide.Motion paths let you create custom animations by moving objects around on a slide. Let's try Zoom;this works but it might be more effective if the words came in one after the other.In Effect options for Zoom, we can choose a vanishing point, but as far as the Sequence, there is no choice forbringing the words in individually.To get more options,click the Dialog box launcher.Now we have threetabs worth of options.Let's look around.In Animate text thereis a By word option.Let's try that. Interesting.It looks like each word iszooming in from its own vanishing point.Let's look at that option again.Here it says % delay between words.Let's see what happenswhen we make that 100%.Perfect.In general, the best way to learnabout animations is to experiment.Start with a rough idea andthen check out the optionsuntil you find what you want.You may also find something better.Now let's dosomething with this text.I want all of it to be onthe slide the whole time butadd some kind of emphasisas I talk about each line, so we don't want to bring the text inor take it out, but add an emphasis.What does Wave look like?Interesting. I'll have to remember that one for another slide but not for this one.What about Brush color?Looks like it's brushing colorover the text one letter at a time.I think this will workexcept for a few things.First, I want to gofrom a dark color to light.We don't see any change nowbecause it's brushing white over white, so select the text and in the mini toolbarselect a fairly dark blue.Now the text is dark until wehighlight it with the animation.The last thing we need to do is bringthe text in one paragraph at a time.That should work. Press Shift-F5, click and the title zooms in.Then as we talk about the specificswe click to add emphasis to each line.Animation can do a lot toadd meaning to your text.For example, we're addingwhite color to the text as we move through theanimation sequence, which makes it appear as if we'rebuilding on the information.Click the Dialog box launcher, click After Animation and select dark blue. Now it appears as if we're moving from row to row without each line building on the previous one.

Ad esempio, è possibile cercare persone di interesse nella società cercando nella directory aziendale. Cercare contatti esterni e partner, ad esempio e quindi inviare un messaggio di posta elettronica. Di conseguenza, è possibile utilizzare gli strumenti di ricerca completi disponibili nell'app di posta elettronica in Outlook, come vi mostrerà in un attimo per cercare nella posta in arrivo le e-mail di determinate persone.Forse per le e-mail relative al contenimento di determinate parole chiave, è anche possibile utilizzare vari filtri e l'ordinamento da utilizzare per modificare la visualizzazione in quei messaggi di posta elettronica nella posta in arrivo.

886,en,How to collaborate: work together or assign parts,233.0,"Hello and Welcome to the short training session or an office move training. This sessions related to usage situation and a particular one is entitled how to collaborate work together and assign parts. My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.So, in this mix session will look at a particular situation and then we'll see how different products from the Office. 365 subscription can help us deal with the situation will start by looking at OneDrive and move on to the OneNote and finally we'll see how your mother social network for business is going to help us.This is a presentation about use possibilities and you can use the rest of the mood curriculum, which we're looking at later as a training action going forward.So this is our situation you're preparing a new company charter with a new internal regulations. The best way to ensure everyone's compliance and support with that is to involve as many people as possible in the creation of the content in the 1st place. However, it's not really feasable to travel to every location to ask everybody's opinions and to get their input and email responses or.These will take too long, so let's see how the various Office 365 tools can help us in this regard, but will start with a brief introduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft that gives organizations a cloud based environment, not only for communication with colleagues and collaborators working together collaboratively but also for the storage of files and documents. It also provides organizations with a cloud based mail service so exchange online cloud based communication tool and service through Skype for business.And cloud based websites through SharePoint online and not only that, but also with your subscription you get online versions of the office applications.Such as word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.So you can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating your web browser to portal dotoffice.com and this could be done for all kinds of devices such as PC's notebooks tablets and my balls. For example, when you log into that URL and connect to your subscription your tenancy will take you to your home page or landing.The click the icon in the top left corner, which you've too. Commonly is the start menu. Online or on the home page itself. You can click one of the different tiles that are available to access the various available. Services such as your mail and calendar and OneDrive Yammer and the online applications such as word, and PowerPoint in OneNote and so on.We look at that live online demo environment now.So he's Office 365 subscription and we can see the various styles that you can click on to access their various applications like mail and calendar and people OneDrive share point sites. We can also see the tiles for the online versions of office applications like word Excel PowerPoint. OneNote top left corner is where we can see our start menu online or so.And that has again all the tiles are available that we can launch from that start menu. So this is the button. You use in the top left corner to move from app to app cluster in those applications. You can move quickly from your mail to calendar or calendar to OneDrive or whatever, whichever tile whichever app. You want to use you can see that these tiles are modifiable has a hover over.3 button 3 dotted button which is called the ellipsis button. You click on that do things like modify their which apps are pinned to that launch button, so if I unpin the planner for example, I can click on view all my apps.And then get give me a list of all my applications that I can add to the.Start menu up there so for example, if I wanted a different tile that they want to swap the pain of tile that we had on there before let's choose the store tile and said I could pin that to the app launcher and they're going to click on the top left, you'll see the store tile is now I did there. Anytime you can move back to the home at home landing page again by clicking on the Office 365 link up here as well.Initial page.And a few things we can do on him in terms of modifying the look, feel and the settings. So on the cog icon up here click on that to get to access the settings. You can modify your theme you can see that some of them are animated to the one we got here called jellyfish for example, that a major theme. There's lots of different colors and themes and so on so.Cats and robots and bricks and what have you so you could select a different theme if you want to apply different things like bricks like say going to con save and you can also modify he'll start page. So rather than landing on this default Office 365 home page. Click on start page. And then from the drop down list. You can select a different app to start with so if you commonly go.As your first port of call in morning. You work with and you can choose that as your landing page. We need to log into Office 365 click on save and the next time you access the portal that will be your start page. Rather, this page. There's a few other things on those work notifications passwords language time zones, etc. For the moment that will do will just show you now you can quickly move around those at.You can click on the start button in the top left corner click on mail wanted your mail app.And you'll see that that theme that we just selected the bricks themes or permeates throughout the different component. Parts of outlook. So here in our mailbox again. We can click up here again go to calendar.And again, you'll see the same thing that the calendar app has the same look and feel to it.Man uses the same theme.We gotta get back to homepage again just click on Office 365 to go back to initial learning page again.I can just head back to the slides for moment.So and in office weeks 5. We saw the URL to connect to to connect the portal portaloffice.com. We saw the tiles available from the start menu. Online or we could modify that start menu as well to add different app tiles to that, launching button. It is going to get the first of the 3 key components of Office 365 they want to look.Situation the first that being the OneDrive tool so OneDrive is online storage capability provided with Office 365 and it allows you to access your documents from anywhere at anytime from different types of devices. It can make working at clapboard server, you much easier even when you're working.So it's easy to download a document to work with it offline or work with it online as well as we'll see in a moment the demo. So when you select a document right click on it or selected you can see on the screen here, you can do various things to it. You can preview the document. You can open the document, either in the online version of the office application.Full version you can share the document with people or by using a link again will show you that in the demo and you can see that the current permissions on a document have shared with that sort of thing you can also download it locally and you can also view version history, so that's quite useful so you can see previous versions of that document and either open them or delete.Pulling back so if you want to look at a restore back an earlier version of a document you can do that, too.So we can see on this slide here, we've got a document selected and you can see some of the options available from this screen. But we'll see some more me look in the live environment environment, so this ellipsis button is one of the tools. You can use to access it. You can also right click on the document name gives you the same kind of capabilities as well.OK, so it's gonna look at that in the live environment as well.So OneDrive to accessible as you can see here as a tab on the home page. It's also accessible from a tile from the launcher on the start menu up here. I've already got a tab open anyway, with OneDrive loaded so also guess which across to that and we can see on here. You got a list of various files and documents that you've stored into your OneDrive.You can also create new files directly in here by selecting this option that create new folders or create new office document file types directly into your OneDrive storage. You can use the upload button here to upload files from your local PC to this OneDrive location and you've also got a sync button here that allows you to sync your your cloud based one.With your local computer so for example, you could take in a downloaded document work with offline. We not connected to the Internet and then when you reconnect again, you can re synchronize those changes back to the online version.So we have some things we can do in here, so you can select a file so let's just scroll down selected document for example, when you select that document you have a menu appears in the top here that you can do things with certain open that file as it's a word file like I've got options. Open it in word online or open it in the full version.I can share the document I can get a link to it download it. Delete move etc. Copy it somewhere rename it and look at its version history. Those same capabilities are available by right clicking on the document rather than selecting it for the menu at the top you can right click on document.And you can see, things you could do again the same type things that you saw in the menu at the top so open it in the application share. It get link download etc. And 1 more way of seeing that. Same information is to use the ellipsis button here click on that and you get the same menu items. So 3 different ways, essentially of working with that document click the lips.Right click the document name or click on the left hand side to select the file and then get use the menu that appears at the top so let's have a look at some of those capabilities, so she said. You can open. Indiana document so we could open it word online if we do that just launch C word online application.And you can then start working that document from there, so a couple of things to bear in mind. Here is 'cause. We're in the online version how we're looking at online document things that you do modifications. You make a saved automatically so if you notice at the top it says documents saved at the moment. If I then start to type some more text and you'll see that changes to say saving and then a few seconds.So it's being saved automatically as you make those changes. You know within a few seconds and then update and say saved in a moment, which is why they goats document save now, which is why on the file menu. You don't have a save option. You have a save. As so you can save it something else like a local on a local director or something there.Because it gets safely automatically which is different from the way that the sort offline full blown versions work OK, so it's just close that down.So you see so that we can open it, we can as I say download a local copy of it. We can also decide to share it. So I want to share the document with someone.We can choose share and then we got 2 versions of doing this, you can either invite people to share it with C concert starts typing. The name second from the list that appears for your directory and then you can decide whether you want to allow that person to just have sort of read only access where they could only view it or do you want to give them change their capabilities that they can edit the document as well. You gotta couple other?That person has to sign or not whether it can be anonymous and whether to send an email invitation. A lot, so that's 1 way of showing it by directly inviting someone to share and giving them. The associated missions that you want the other way is to use get a link so we get a link. You select the type of link you want. Maybe it's just a view only link or maybe it's needed.We want people to be able to access it anonymously or perhaps you want to sign in with the corporate account. So you can choose different types of link here, so if I choose to view link. No sign in required is essentially anonymous link that people can use to that view it and when I select that it creates a link in here shows me the URL I can just click on copy which then copies it to the.And then that can be used to paste into email message or into a Skype for business chat window or something to paste that link to someone else and allow them to view that file so for example, if I switch back to my office tile and then open mail for example.Items up outlook mailbox, so if I want to then create a new email.I could then just paste that?Link that we just created an ever going into the document and then send off to a colleague and they could then see that and connect that share So what are they after they visited within the email select that link and I'll give them the guess the appropriate location and the guest access token that allows them to get that view access only.OK, it's good discard that message, not going to send it.So that's the way it is safe for sharing that document someone using just a URL link and unassociated access token. You can also set expires on those links as well so they can only last for a day or couple days. Whatever shared option here allows you to show what the items being shared with those who have been shared with.Things like modify the permissions on the advanced button here, which gives you more granular permission capabilities or you can decide to stop showing or someone by using the button here other things you can do.This way we can see delete it move it rename it manage the file itself rename it something else look at its details. We can also see version history, so frickin version history that shows us any previous versions. That document that we worked on who buy does the size change with any comments added you could use the drop down list here to go back?These versions and either just view them. Delete them or store them back again to get an earlier version if you want to retrieve that back.So lots of different options, they have in terms of things you can do to collaborate with other people on the document. Not only can you just work on the document itself, so I can open a document in word online and work for their other people could be doing the same thing, so you can have a true real time collaboration, where more than one person is working on a file at the same time as the file is store.OneDrive and if you both got access to it, you can both work on it. Collaboratively even within the same document on the same page and in different paragraphs for example, OK. Let's go back to the slides from it.So the next tool want to show you is OneNote and that could be used for to in terms of collaboration a particular situation.So you know talk about creating company charter document here so you've got access ability by the users in other words, other people can access it because there's an online version of OneNote as well as the full blown version from the full office suite, it has inbuilt version management and Co Authoring cake.As well so you could use this tool in the following ways to swap tomorrow collaboration by giving a draft document, allowing other people to modify the document by sharing with them, letting them access, it and then you can also view their changes. View multiple authors. So there's some buttons is also in a minute in the demo that show you how you can view the various or.You could also against the other versions of it if you got previous versions of the document as well. So it's a note management taking creation and management tool that let's you provide access to other people. They can then have their input into the document in this case, the corporate corporate company charter.And then see you know what changes they've made which automate those changes and also because previous versions of if you want to as well.So again let's have a look at in the live environment.So we can either open OneNote online from again. The home page. Up here from the start menu or from within OneDrive If you want to actually open an application. So here we got this company chance document. It's not actually a company charter document, but we're just going to use it for the demo, I can then select that document.Choose open in OneNote online.That then open the OneNote online application for us.And we can then see the document that moment. So it's got you know heading a piece of text a graphic another link inside it. For example, moment and you can then obviously make changes that document and make additions to it. But if you want. Other people to have input into that document as well. Then you could then share it for other people, so if they can share.Or use the invite people option here to allow someone else to connect to it, so going to choose user 2. Standard is another demo user. We can either give them view only permissions or edited version. They want to get medic permission, so they can actually access document and make some changes to it, and again. We can decide where they want them to be required to sign in eyes.And we won't send an email invitation or not, and we click on share.So that's now been shared with these are 2 DOT standard so if I just.Use the other persons connection.So I'm just going to drag across user twos window, so he's got his OneNote online open here, so there's a white ones. He's worked on recently there's own notebooks and he cums also see notebooks that have been shared with him, says that company charter document for example, we just shared it and select that document.And so we can now sort of see that we both work in the same document note. This pops up, here, saying John Doe is also here so that's my other user and it shows you where which pages on that thing is on the same page and similarly if I just move this out the way for a moment you'll see that I also have but not here, letting me know that you know, someone else is working that document as well.So this other person now can add their own material, so from here. They could say go down to here. Let's not try their own content.So they can make it insert text pictures links online pictures audio even can be uploaded in tears while addons that kind of thing as well. Tables so could I didn't link there for example, you can specify display text so let's.In 2016.I can stages and then they just have to provide a URL so it's just Lincrusta. Their examples just adapt example. But just something so we got something we can copy and paste in really just to show us what we're doing? How can we use it?And use insert and I'm at that and so again what it does. This remember using an online version of a document here. This OneNote application so make those changes as we work on it, so if I just move that out, the way for a moment.We'll see that contents now been added. So we could see it in the user ones version. He can also see that contents now period. The documents been saved online and this is we can get your sort of collaboration tools being used here because you can choose the view options up here to show authors. So if I click on show authors. It will show you little block telling you which.Piece of content being created by what user so this is a good way, then having multiple pieces of content from multiple authors in your team have things been put into this company charter so you can see who's made? What changes in which pieces of content belong to? Who and you can also use the view option here to see page version, so if it's been earlier versions of the document.Those can be linked to down here, you can select the item and then you can sort of restore and delete it. Get back to it using these other options available up here.So very simple to just share create create create some content. Some draft content share the document. Other people team. Invite them to contributes content to it, and then have them access. It online work with it collaboratively and Co. Authoring mode with you and be able to view those changes by viewing the.By showing the authors of those different pieces of content and that's just a toggle switch that turns it on and off so great way to collaborate on a document together.OK let's get back to the slides.So the last too long to show you who is the Yammer application.So after creating your own internal company charter. Maybe you have people voted their pieces of content to it's a sort of moment ago. You've worked on it, collaboratively with other things, you could do with India over to help you within Yammer to help you collaborate around that as well. So you can use Yammer to inform interested parties about dates made the document you can post your discussion.Conversation in Yammer, you can also upload the file so they can see a copy of the fallen at their own comments in the conversation. You could ask colleague again to post the comments about it in the replies and you can also use the Yammer chat tool. There's little chapter within Yammer to quick chat. So, your colleagues about the document or the project. You're working on and so on before we go ahead and.So you can operate around the shared document you can have simultaneous documenting by virtue of the fact we've really seen those capabilities in. In 1 note. We close to the same thing in Word With Co Authoring in world for example, or PowerPoint and you can use the document management capabilities of those other tools will see in a moment and we can preview the document access it down.And so on from within your mass will see in the demo now, so switch back to the live environment.In his latest.Ocean of the charter.Example.And then I could provide a link to that document so you can either upload files you directly from your computer or from files that you've already uploaded Yammer or I could just paste in a link to that, so if I switch back to OneDrive where my company charter document is and then choose the option to share I can just choose that get a link to create a link so again if I wanted like an edit link with people don't.And it is document, I could think copy that blink or for interview link only or link choirs that I log in with the corporate account and you can structure that link you want click on copy.Close.And then post it into Yammer in there.And other people to be notified that consent to the users as well.So I could post like a link like so and then people could just go and access that by accessing the link.When they're in my Yammer Group.Click on the link and then taken flat document.And they can install to edit and work on the document as well, and make comments on it. Or they could just replying to make replies to that particular update Post that have made here so I could just reply to create a conversation thread about that particular document is also lots of other things, you can do in terms of.Sharing things so you can share the conversation itself with other people.

You can choose to email me when there's been that message, you can have it emailed to you directly or if you're not interested in the conversation anymore. You can decide to hide the conversation.You've also got the chat tool down here. The bottom right corner click on there and anyone who's online in the audio particular group is only the service in this group anyway. In this demo environment. But you can then start to chat with your colleagues your coworkers about this particular update so perhaps if you've posted it. They've had to look at it. They've been some replies in here and you can have a chat with.Tit and collaborate in that manner as well.Let's go back to the slides.So the tools you've looked at briefly in this sessions. It can help you to share and collaborate with your coworkers on documents online or offline OneDrive provides that.Cloud based storage location for files that can be shared with your coworkers. We need to be sorted from OneDrive. You cannot open documents in the full office version on the online version of the app to both sort of un oh and or edit them. That includes working in real time collaboration with other colleagues on the same document simultaneously by using those coaching capabilities of the office applications.When when those files are stored in online and you're working on them as online files either Monday or windows. SharePoint document library. For example, you can use OneNote online to create drafts. We document and have other people tried content. That document review. This changes you'll see, those modifications by multiple authors and you can also use.To manage quick and easy notes yourself related to that particular document or project and you can then use Yammer to post updates about documents or projects unity working on review replies in that conversation thread related to that document and also store. You can upload copies of those files, either linked to the more upload local copies from your.Into the Yammer post so team members can view those documents comment on them in the conversation thread as well, and lastly. We saw we can use the chat tool to chat with your coworkers again and collaborate with them in that way about updates to your documentation.So there are several post trading resource available T to Suffern Hardshaw Mick training experience.

887,en,How to search: find what you need,169.0,"Hello and Welcome to the short training session on office move training. This sessions related to usage situation and this particular. One is entitled search. Find what you need my name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this sort session.In this makes session will look at a particular situation and then see how different products in Office. 365 subscription can help us deal with the situation will start by looking at OneDrive. Then Yeah, Matt and finally we'll see how death can help us. It's a presentation about use possibilities. You can use the rest of the curriculum which will look at.Any action going forward.So this is our situation your coworkers are distributed across different locations and some of them are telly working. You don't want to base. Their latest updates work up codes latest report submissions and you don't miss out on modifications made to documents by your colleagues. So let's see the other various Office 365 tools can help us in this regard, butJust have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft that gives organizations are cloud based environment, not only for communicating with colleagues and working together collaboratively but also for the storage of files and documents and so on Office 365 provides organizations with cloud based mail service or exchange online. The cloud based communication tool and service through.And also cloud based websites through SharePoint online and not only that, but also with online versions of the office applications such as word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.You can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating your web browser to portaloffice.com and this can be done for all kinds of devices such as notebooks tablets, PC's and mobile devices.When you log into this URL so excuse your homepage. Or your landing page where you can either click on the icon in the top left corner.Which we refer to as a start menu online or on the landing page itself the home page. You can click the different tiles available to access the various available services such as mail in calendar. OneDrive Yammer and the office applications. The online version of the office applications such as word online PowerPoint online etc so.That live online demo environment.So here we can see the home page of a Office 365 tenant at an Office 365 subscription and we can see on here all the tiles that we can click on to access the various services and applications available mail in calendar. And so on, and there's are online versions of office applications.Up in the top left corner is our start menu. Online button and this opens up and shows you the sort of tile launch or the Apple watch with a different tiles available notice that when you hover over these tiles. You can see they have an ellipsis button next to them. If you click on that allows you to unpin unpin different tiles to this, launching pad to this start menu.Click there to unpin the planner app from the app launcher. For example, so if we click on view. All my apps. We can then go and select an application from list to add back to our start menu. So we could add the planner tile back again or we get a different one for example, store so click on the store and we click on the little Italy.Nuts and pin tap launcher and if we look in the start menu. Online and button at the top will see the store tile is now on the launcher. You click on the Office 365 link to get back to that original home landing page. Let's do that to get back to the homepage.Just a couple of things on here as well. There's a notifications bar appear if you get recent notifications there appear in here and your settings are available by this cog icon so if we click on the little cold up here in the top right corner and you can modify things such as your theme here so you change your look and feel and the environment, so let's select you can see that's different color?Isn't this various icons and a couple of more animated and Sciences cats and robots and all sorts of things will choose Lego bricks. For example, for this one.Click on save.And we can also change our landing page. I'll start page. So it is set to the Office 365 home page. Which is the page. You can see here we can click on this drop down list and select another page, so for example, you typically go to your mail pages. You'll start put in the morning. Then you can make your landing page. Mail click on save to say that next time we logged in will find.First log into the system you can also do things like modifying notifications and change your password and modify language and time zone settings here as well. We'll leave it at the moment there and so to launch these different applications. You can either click. The tiles on this home page or from any part of Office 365 from any page. You can just click in the top left corner on the start menu.And the selected appropriate tile so it just open a couple of these up showing how quick it is to access the applications and switch between them, so click on the mail tile to prop mail.And we could see how mail application loading from outlook so member outlook is still 3 components. Essentially, there's the mail component. A calendar and the contacts or people as it's known in Office 365 and you can see that the theme that the Lego bricks. Type thing I selected. This is sort of permeates throughout the product is available in each of these products as you'll see so there.The mailbox because then also click in the.Start menu again click on the calendar tile to open up the calendar to 60. How easy it is to quickly switch between these various applications of components and there's our calendars and then we could do the same to switch for example, to people to view our contacts.And again, you can see this theme permeates throughout the different component parts.OK, we go back to the landing page again.And then will head back to the slides for a moment.So that was just quick introduction to the Office 365 portal environment. So we saw the URL to connect anyway. So they can see the different tiles are able to click on to launch those applications and we saw the start menu. In line button up in the top left hand corner. Let's launch all applications by little mini tiles in the start menu.Caitians components and see how they can help us in this particular situation so the first thing to look at is OneDrive.So we wanna drive you can use the online storage capabilities in Office 365 of the one drive service to access your documents from anywhere at anytime from any device. Essentially we got Internet access and that way. You work, and document type searches will be much easier even when you're working remotely so for example, you can click on.Find in the OneDrive storage facility and right click on a document example and open the document share the document. People view the permissions on a document and modify those missions. You can download a document. You can view it's version history of those kinds of things and I'll show you those in a moment in the live environment.You can also use the search tools available in OneDrive to look for sort of relevant content and information and that can be all every type of content or you could just search for people specifically or conversations or even videos so each search can be broken down by sort of content type if you like.So simple refined searches.So you can do a search in OneDrive up in the top left corner just for a sort of phrase or word. For example, and then I'll show you all the documents that have that as part of the title in the document example.Or you can do it more refined search where you can use a search and then insert shoe. Your share point sites. Find the documentation and at the top you can see that it's split into different categories. That say it's in French, but it's it's in all or people conversations or video so you can look for specific types of content rather than just all types of content.Down that search and refine it somewhat.So that's going to look at that again in the in the live environment.Save my office is 5 landing page. You can either click. The OneDrive tile. From here or you can click it in the start menu. All I'll do is actually right click on it, and choose to open in a separate tab so you can leave that home page loaded as well.And we can see if we got the famous files and and have OneDrive location. You can see a few menu items up here that says things like gnu so you can create a gnu gnu types of content word Excel PowerPoint content. For example, you can upload files into your OneDrive folder from local machine and you can also have this sync button that allow you to sync.Hold it with your local computer as well. So OneDrive is like a storage location. Cloud based storage location to that. You store your files and share them with people and so on. So when you click it when you look at a file you'll see next to this ellipsis button. You can do things like select the file over the left hand side here and then you'll get a menu appear at the top.All the kind of things you can do to that file and open it in its application or open in the online version of the application. The office application to share it to get a link to it download. Delete move it, etc. Rename it and look at this version history. You can do thinking will says by right clicking on a document gives you the same capabilities, but in a sort of right hand right click can't.And you can also use the ellipsis button. This little 3 dots next to document to open up the same menu as well. So these are the things you can do to a document for example, so you can do things to say like open it in the application. So you could open a spreadsheet in Excel online. We can open it in the full Excel Version Office. You can share a document.You click on share and you get the ability to share it via an invitation so you going to invite people to share that document. You can give them betas to view permissions, so you can type in the name of the user.And then provide them with the editor. View rights matter message for the invitation as well. If you want to send many limb email invitation till it know they're getting this shared resource. The other way of inviting is rather doing invitation on per person. You can do it via link where you create a link either. An editor review type link and that could be either anonymous.So it can require a sign in with with a couple of corporate account and then you just provide the link is as a copy so you create the link and you can copy that link it's in here.I just painted into instant chat window into an email for example.So if I went into Skype for business for example, I could then.Send a message instant message and then just paste that URL of it just copied from the link in their instant message window.I do that here.Sort of pace it in there just paste in the URL.To that particular document and also provides the access token as part of that link to given the rights whether you decided to give an edit link or reviewing any link. For example, you could also do the same thing and paste into an email and do the same thing there.OK on the shared with just shows you how it's currently shared with and what their rights. Are you can stop sharing from there, you can do advanced permission settings or by the advanced button just gives you an idea the kind of things you can do in terms of sharing that said, you can download it. Sit down at your local copy to work with offline for example, you can look at the version history so.It's been multiple versions of that document you can see who's worked on it when when it was last modified who buy if there's any comments made on it, and you could even use the drop down list and then sort of get back in time to the other view the older version. Delete it or even restore back. The older version. If you want to need to so that's quite useful so I don't wanna drive.Nothing will show here is to do with searching superior to our situation. You want to search for content. So you gotta search button up in the top left corner. This is in the new version. This is so that you can. This is the standard version of search so I could do in a search in there for test for example, and that will come up with a list of apps documents that have the word testing or other parts of the body.You can then either select one that's found in the list. We click on search. Everything and that will then return a list of all those documents and you could then you look for the one that you that you think are most interested in another way, doing a more refined search. This is all types of documents and folders and different things. Here is to use the classic OneDrive so that's good.Corner could return to classic OneDrive shows you in a slightly different version of OneDrive is of you.I won't use the search tool in there.To do the same thing, so again if I you search up there.And then to search everything so it's very similar in doing so, you can click on search everything.It will then give you this web page with the documents in and you can look at previews of those documents are hovering over them you can also then filter your your search results by rather having on all results. You can do it by people. So it's only people that have the word test in the name for example, or conversations that have.That word in there with none of those anyway. But more videos, that have the word testing as well. So there might be some video content that are looking for that has a that key word for example, it OK.Just got back to OneDrive again.OK so you can use that as I said, OneDrive for you know quick searches when you're looking for relevant content and information for example using keywords and might only use it. Can I search by documentation, but also for people conversations and videos as well? Let's head back to the sites for moment.So originally we saw the simple search. We just type in the sort of menu. When you view of an drive. You type in a word, and just get all the documentation. They have that word in like keyword in returned and they refined search is the one where you can look for results of a certain type so either by file type or buying whether it's all.All results or just people are just conversations just videos and that's up there.So the next we're going to look at his yama.So for example, we want to your colleagues publishes a document hammers are very useful tool for informing all those relevant interested parties and contacts quickly and simply about those latest updates.So a very simple to use again, you can do searching within Yama and you can sort of search for content regardless of you know if you don't know where it's located doesn't matter. You could use the global search box to find content regardless of where it's located sort of global search or if the document stated in a particular group. You can use targeted search within the groups in.And you could do things in terms of following uses and following contents. When you find something out that documentation are interested in you? Can follow that or if you find a user you're interested in following you can follow that as lots of that social networking aspect to yama?So we have a look at what we can do in Yammer in the live environment now.So, just like other applications, Jammers available as a one of the tiles on the on the start menu. And on the home page. This iama has it same tile so you can see in here looking at this Yammer Group.And I can post updates, so I can.Post updates bounce documentation have you seen this latest report for example.And then I could decide who I want to post this update do you want to see this notification this update so it can be all company just sort of cultural group or I can add specific people from the list. In my group as any competent people in this group as happens anyway. But I can add people individually. So I could get rid of the old company, if I only only one.Vivian and a couple other people in my team for example, I can then also add the file so I could uh profile.Document.So this happened, it as a sort of American then to send that offers a post.So there's my post just been updated so people can then you know when they're browsing the group can see that life just reposted it. They can do other things. Well, they can do. Lots of social networking things like like like the conversation reply to it share the conversation, so you click on share and you can share it with another group by posting in a different group or you can send it to private message to someone.You can also click on the ellipsis button here and so you feel the things you could do so stop following a conversation view the entire conversation. Bookmark it for reference. Later on, you can have a email that message to yourself and you can hide the conversation. If you're not interested in it or delete it if it's one that you posted.Now you can also do things like follow people so you can hover over the person so if I hover over Vivian for example, over here, you can see that I can see it a little contact card about that user mobile number work number email address. And so on, and I could then also follow that user so I can receive future posts in this user by following them.And you can see that I can do the same thing to their their post down here. I can follow it. I could follow in my inbox as well so that means they follow that conversation. I'll get new replies in my xamarin box and that yammering boxes up here by the way in the top left corner. Next your home button is the inbox button and that's where you can see your messages that come through.Positions you're interested in that you're following off from people's private personal messages as well as also notifications button here that tells you about notifications like if you got new followers or you followed someone else or this some new content that you're following related to a conversation that kind of thing.I see it's also search box. I can use Yammer for searching for content. So this is what we wanted us to find some content so I can start just type in a sort of keyword.Search an item.And I'm going to get another select an item from the list. I found also you will search results.I come to you the full conversation, I can just look look at very brief preview of that which is the one I just posted officer moment ago and you can see a good option.Do things like share that again. So I get the same sort of share this with a group or send it via private message.Anna can also download that document, I can go to the file and open it, I can follow document if I followed it already as well, or conversation.I can also click on the file itself just click on that link to file that opens up in word online. So I can preview it. So you can hear it, see here that we sort of have an interaction between word online and Yammer itself, so this is like a small word online preview page. Within Yammer and I can then browse through that document you can see.Give me a print it download as PDF.Feel the things will get help on it, so and also down the right. You can still see it. The same sort of capabilities for sharing it downloading as well. I'm going to file properties from here.Slick in across up here to close it down again.And you can also see him, yeah that you can have their group, so you can get suggested groups. You can join groups. You can browse for new types of groups. You can create your own group and that kind of thing to join existing groups to collaborate with other people and with the content they're producing so typically have a team.Group or something like that, they're working on this field, things you can do also anytime with just posting updates. You can have poles. You can create your own polls in here, you can praise people so you can praise a person select some type in the name.And then you could use these sort of icons in here to this idea would be praising for so perhaps some good work on project or something like that, and you can also do announce this as well to announce things again to the company or to specific people by supplying their names up here.And the loss of interest to chat box. You can see the bottom right corner here search. The chat box. Open up that shows you which people online from your group now and you can start to chat with him within that, so if you're collaborating on a bit document. Perhaps you just uploaded it and then people started to reply and comment on that document you could then have also converse.The chat window down here as well.OK let's get back to the slides again.So you're going to help us in terms of looking for content finding the latest publications of report and documentation using the searches to find people subject. Some groups that were interested in and we can then follows conversations follow those people.And the last piece are going to look at is the Dell product.So still looking for information on the latest publications and and updates, so delve is helps us. Discover information that is most interesting to you so sore right across the Office 365 environment. So you can use it to find information again about people and then help others to find you and also to find other documentation. You could do things that you can click on someones name or picture.What organs they currently working on learn more about them you don't have to know the title of a document or it's stored used Delta collects information for you based on the content that's available shows you the documents whether this stored in OneDrive for business, or site in SharePoint online Office 365.So when you get this sort of gathering information. An overview of that content. You can see here for example, we've got some pages where there's some French lie, but I'll show you the English one moment that shows you these contact with these cards of content content cards and you can click on them and say.Abort and we could use boards in Delta Group and share related documents so for example, you can create a board collector project documents of your team and then board sort of make it easy to collect to discover content and they're easy to share with other people too. You can also as you track documents and find contact you like you can add to your face.Document your favorite you can add aboard your favourites and then when you find it just to just click on the star in the top right corner have a contact card and add it to a favor board in that way. Only Dell venue shows you documents that you've already got permission to access so you won't see content that isn't available to you so that it takes away their frustration of trying to click.Access them when you don't have access to them, so only shows you to stuff that you have access to an permission to view and any other people again. We have to see any of your private documents. If you haven't given them rights to do so. So let's have a look now in their lives over and see how it's not easy to find people in documents Internet. I'll just show you that.Let's we had to contact how to board to show you what it looks like on the in English page. There's a place some of these sub content cards here and you can click on the stars up in the top right corner to add them to your favourites and you click on the add to boarding at the bottom to Adam to a board or to create a new board and then start to build up content that's evident.But in in Delph, so let's show, you that in the live environment what it looks like.So again Delph has its home tile on here, you can see the delft. I like what you got one open in the next tab. So to switch over to that, so this is what day looks like on the home page for user so I think on home here. This is the page are actually already could call me. It shows you. That person is PPS relates to and showed him face melt their profile.You can see where recent documents, they worked on so on, so if I under people. If I got other people.

You favorited and also a favorite board do you favorited?You can also click on these buyers heads you get a bit more information about that particular item.And you've also got search capabilities within delve so let's go back to the top here and then type in.A search phrase example, so I'm just typing the word calendar in there, says now. Give me different results for Canada so different. It's a content they have that verify that word has been found somewhere in the content and then layoff me again to then add these to feet to my favourites up here. So get that. These other documents that I haven't yet gotten my favorite, saying now listed in favorites as well.And notice also want to found a document I can then also actually select the document. Just click on it in there and then all that open up that particular application. In this case word online.

Soit is essential youprovide a response to thatwithin the next hour or so. To dothis,you need the participationand collaboration from differentcolleagues.Each one offers you knowspecific different elements thatmust be employed in the reportthat your client is waiting for.Everyone appears to be availablebut the only issue is: There areonly two of those six people areactually in your office.So let's see how we deal withthat situation. First we'll have aquick introduction to theOffice 365 environment.So just to talk about Office 365itself, so this is a subscriptionservice from Microsoftthatgives organizations a Cloudbased environment, not only forcommunication with theircolleagues and working togethercollaboratively but also forstorage of files and documentsand so on.It providesorganizations with Cloud basedMail service to exchange online.As part of this subscription,also Cloud based communicationtool and service via Skype forBusiness online, Cloud basedwebsites through SharePointonline and also online versionsof office applications such asWord, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.You can access the Office 365subscription by navigating inyour web browser to portal.office.com and that'saccessible from severaldifferent devices: PCs,And when you log intothat portal.office.com,It'lltake you to your homepage orlanding page.You can eitherclick on the icon in the Topleft corner up here, which werefer to as the start menuonline;Or on the landing page itself.You can click on the differenttiles available to access thevarious availableserviceswhich is your Mail or Calendaror OneDrive, SharePoint andthe Office online applications.So let's take a quick look ata live environment now and onthe online demo environment.So here we can see an Office365 subscription. We're on thehomepageIn Office 365.That issort of the first landing pageyouget when you log in.And there's a few things we cansee on here; We can see the tilesthat we can click on to accessthe various component parts. Sowe got 3 pieces of the Outlooktool here: Mail, Calendar andpeople to your Contacts; We'vealso got access to Yammer tile,OneDrive for storage,SharePoint for websites; And we alsohave some other tools on here likethe Planner and Video and Delve.And you can also see we havetiles for the Office onlineapplications, namely: Word, ExcelPowerPoint and OneNote.We click in the Top leftcorner; This click is your""Start Menu"" online button.We can see that shows us all thetiles that we can again with theapplicationswe can launch viathat start button and this ismodifiable;What's on thislaunchpad here because you cansee as I hover over each of thetiles.This little Ellipsisbutton that I can click on; so ifyou wanted to swap this storetile for example, for adifferent tile, click on thatEllipsis button, choose unpinfrom the launcher and then if wego to click View all my apps,we'll see a list of all thedifferent applications that areavailable for us to add to theStart menu; So let's add tosomething else... uh... the Plannerfor example.Let's click on that andpin to App launcher.And if we go back to the homepage.We can see already thatit is on the start menu.And if Iclick on it now, you can seethe Planners now been added.Let's click back on the Startpage as well.Homepage to getback to where we started.And a couple of things I want toshow on here is the Settingsbutton; So click on the cog uphere in the Top right.It opens  up the settings menu andfrom here, you can do thingslike modify your theme the lookand feel of the environment.Youcan see there's quite a lot tochoose from.Various colorsdifferent themes snow, ice, cats,robots, circuits, all sorts ofdifferent things.We'll try aLego bricks.Or bricks and thensave that theme.We can also do things likechange our landing page, sorather than just startingon the defaultHomepage, this is apage that we can see.Now wecan click on this drop downlist and choose a differentpage to start from so if youmost commonly go to your Mail,sort of your first thing in themorning,then you might want tochoose that as your landingpage.You'll start page toclick on save you can also seeoptions here for things likechanging your password andchanging the language and timezones... We'll leave those for themoment just close the settingsdown.And if I want to launch anapplication.I got the choice ofeither clicking on the tilesdown here to launch one orclicking in the start menu.Uphere to do the same thing.So wecan do either.Let's click onthe Mail app here to open upmailbox.So this is a Mailcomponent of Outlook.And you can see that that themesort of permeated through intothe product as well.Since our mailbox if I clickagain, you can see how quicklyhow easy it is to switch fromapp to app.So I want to go tothe calendar and said, justclick on the start menu clickon the calendar tile.So it is much quicker to go use thestart menu to switchapplications than it is to go backto the landing page andselect on that tileson the homepage.But eitherwill work just the same way.And Lastly off just to showanother one in here, so ifyou want to open peopleduring our Contacts list.Wecan do that as well.And again, you see the themeis through there as well, andwe can see the same sort oflook and feel is available OK.I'm just going to click backon the homepage again.And switch backto our slidesfor a moment.So going back to our slides, sojust look at the portal there inthe tiles available in the startmenu.In the Top left corner.Wealso looked at the settingsavailable from the settings iconby clicking on the cog up in theTop right hand corner.So let's go back to think aboutour situation so.Some of our coworkers are notworking in the office; they're awayin different locations.Therefore, they don't have fullaccess to the full officeapplication suite Office 365still provides them with quickaccess to those online versionsof Word, Excel, and PowerPoint andOneNote, so they can work withthem remotely and collaborateon the projects and documents andfiles and so on with us; So thoseonline apps offer real timecollaboration and co-authoringcapabilities.So in terms oftrust, to sort of finalize ourdocument remotely, not an issuethere.Now that we've got access to theseonline application versions.Andthey also support collaborativework in real time and co-authoring capabilities, usingthe online or the on-premisesfull blown editions.So kick off by looking at Wordonline first of all to see how thatcan help us.So as part of ourOffice 365 subscription as said.we get all the online versionsof the office applications andWord online allows us tosimultaneouslyedit documents.This works not justfor the online versionbut also, if you've got the full onpremises versions officeapplications as well.They workcollaboratively in just the sameway, allowing you to doco-authoring.So when you'reworking on the document at the sametime as another user,You'll seea visual indicator that alerts you tothe fact that someone else iseditingthe document at thesame time as you; And it also shows you the whereabouts in thedocument,they're currentlyworking so now you know...which sort of sections to avoidwhile you're also working somewhereelse in the document.Even onthe same page or slide.You canbe working on the same slide orpage; so as long as you're not workingdirectly on the sameParagraph, for example, block of text as theother users.So up here we cansee thatwithout synchronous aswe said modifications you gotvisibility of that going on soup in the Top right of theslide.You can see that thescreenshot here, which is thescreenshot that you'll see inPowerPoint at the moment to showyou when someone else is editinganother slide in the samePowerPoint deck as you're working on.We also have security of those modifications, one becausewe know other people working init.At the same time, and sortof block us from working in thesame area.But we also have theavailability of using versionhistory.So we can go into.Look at the versions of aparticular document from ourSharePoint site for example.or OneDrive, look at itsversion history and then use itto either view that earlierversion or or delete it or evenrestore it back to a previousversion by selecting the olderfile and restoring it backagain.One other thing also,notice when you're working withthe online versions of documentsis that there's no Save options.There's no file save option.That's because, as you work inthe online versions.Yourdocuments are savedautomatically and you'll seethat visibly that as you starttyping a Word document ora PowerPoint slide; And youmake changes you'll see.Itsays saving and then savedimmediately just a couple ofseconds after it so thosethings happen in on live asyou... as you're making thoseedits to the online document.So we'll switch over to thelive demo environment againand see that in action.So to see that collaboration,real time collaboration action,go to one of the SharePointsites already opened; TheSharePoint site here withdocuments in it.I can see we'vegot some...PowerPointfiles in here and some PowerPointslide decks also got a mailingdocument.And if I right clickon one of those we'll see we getthe option to open it in thefull blown office version or inthe online version of PowerPoint;You can see we can also dothings like download the file,share it... rename, delete or copy.Look at the version history.And so on if we do the similarthing by clicking on theellipsis button here.This opensup more options.We click on thethree dots is the ellipsis.Youget quick preview of that fileso you can see in this case,it's a slideshow slide deck.And as the slide so you cansee, things like you knowwhen it's changed and who isshared within the URL toconnect it.You can open it,share it.follow it and alsoby clicking on the moreactions ellipsis button here.You can see we get the sameoptions as we do when weright clicked on the file sothose same options are thesame ones that you see whenyou right click on it here,so that allows you to say toopen in the full version orin the online version.Similarly, with the Word docyou get the same options.In fact, I would open that on inPowerPoint online first.I'llshow you that and then I'll showit in Word as well.It's not justloading up thatslide deck.We dohave someone else is working onthis file so we should see in amoment when they open it aswell.They will get anotification informing us thatsomeone else is working on thatparticular file.And you see that just poppedup announces appear VivienGoude is also editing.And that will change and showwhat slide they're working on asthey move around the document sofor example, if I get them toclick on slide 2,you should see this updates toshow them editing slide 2, OK.And on their side of things,they show me as editing on slide1, I'll just bring that.Across you to see that.So this is their view,if they see me workingon slide 1 over there.And if I go to the sameslide that they're workingon, IE slide 2.Get them to startworkingwith some of the textfor example.You'll see that now pops up,showing us that Vivien Goude isworking in that section of thedocument.So you get thesevisual indicators that you knowthat someone else is working indid not just that.They'reworking but also that theirwhereabouts in the documentthey're editing at the moment.Somebody could do the samething for Word, let's switchback to Word.And I will open up here.Mailing document.And it will open up inWord online.A similar thing will happenhere will get indicators thatsomeone else is working inthe document as well.So already we can see that Vivien Goude is in that document.And again if I get them tohighlight or something startworking on the text.You'll seeindicators popping out the show,you where abouts they're workingin the document in that time, soagain visual indicators.So youknow that that part of thedocuments currently being workedon and who by.The next thing I want toshow you is the versionhistory information.So I'll just get themto make a minor change.And you can see that changeoccuring on our screen thatVivien has made a change to thatdocument.And notice it says savedup in the Top pyramid in themenu bar, so that'sautomatically saved and.As you're working on it,and you'll notice if Iclick on the File menu.There's only a ""Save as"", there is no ""Save"" option because savesbecause saves are made automaticallywhen you're working directly on the onlineversions of theseapplications.So let's switch back to thedocument library again.And this time, we're going tolook at the version history of thedocument. Click on versionhistory.Then you can accessthat either by right clickingon it or by going to theellipsis and looking at thesecond ellipsis button and nowwe can see the first version.Now we got second versionschange the slight change insize.There may also be someadditional comments.That might have beenadded by that user.And we can see the date and timehave changed.And note, youcould click on these dropdownarrows here... this allows you toview that version.Delete theversion or restore to thatversion as well.OK let's head back to theslides for a moment again.So there we saw how in Wordonline and indeed the otherapplications like PowerPointaligned or we can get that realtime collaboration andvisibility of the effect thatsomeone else is working in thedocument and indeed whereaboutsin the document working and whothey are so you might seesomeone working in a certainparagraph of the report and youcould go into instant messagechat in Skype and also see themin it and then pops of a chatwith about you know whatchangesthey're making and where they're making them and so on, sothat you get real collaborationand the security of thosemodifications by virtue of thefact that one,you can see thatthey're doing, it and whatthey're doing, and where they'reworking and also the fact thatyou've got access to the versionhistory, too.Restore back toother versions or view the changesmade by the people as you'reworking.So the second token tolook at in this part isthe Skype for Business.So you've modified that finalversion of the document in realtime with other colleagues.Youmay want to use Skype forBusiness to alsolaunch meetingsfor discussing peoples tasks orstart a brainstorming sessionwith other coworkers and so on.So Skype for Business is very easy touse, I often get to used the analogyhere for sort of a remotecontrol orzapper that just reallyquick of the button to see ifsomeone's available hover oversomeone's picture to see andinteract with them.So you cansee they're available.You canclick the buttons that pop outto start an instant messagechat.I am chat.You can have avoice call or video call see thatcontact card.And so on, so thatavailability also known aspresence permeates throughoutthe product So what you see inSkype for Business in terms ofavailability is also viewable inOutlook Mail.Calendar.And people in Contacts andso on, as well.So not only is availabilityavailable to you, but also youcanstart over here an instantmessage chat you can start avoice video call and andthere's lots of toolsavailable for collaboration,Wilster in those conferencecalls and video calls thatallow you to do things liketransfer files.Addattachments to theconversation or havingcoauthor on office documentsand also you can do remotepresentation.So you canpresent your entire desktopor an individual program thatyou select or you can presenta PowerPoint file as well aspart of that conference that'sgoing on.So let's again have a look atthat in the live environment.So here we are... We got Skype forBusiness opened up here; we got version2016.We can see they're logged inas John Doe, which is sort of thename used for the userone DOTstandard account.I'm currentlylogged in for the demos and wecan see I can change my status.Here I can sign out or we canset myself as busy or do notdisturb or appear away or I cansign out.Next step as well.From here and one thing.I wantto show you here is that whenI'm I've also got the Office 365app open as well, just to showyou how that's integration worksso if I click on the Mail appfor example, the Mail tile.In Office 365 to launchthe mailbox.The Mail application give it afew seconds to load.And we should see that presenceinformation in the availabilityinformation that permeatesthrough to these products aswell it will take a few secondsjust for the different foldersto load up in Outlook.So you can see here that showingus available, so if I changethat to busy for example, thatwill update again over here verybrief very quickly and again ifI click on away.You should seethat update again.Let's go backto available again.So you cansee that that presenceinformation permeates throughoutthe product and it's sort ofcommon across the products andthat includes also, if we gointo the calendar or to people aswell, the same thing wouldapply.I'm going to minimizethat so we can concentrate onthe Skype for Business tool fora moment so Skype for Businesshere.We can see it's acommunication tool for instantmessaging voice and video calls.And it's laid out into Contactsand conversations and meetings,so the context is normally mainpart, you're working this showsyour?...Current Contacts and itshows you in 3 different ways,so by groups Contacts by groupsContacts by status Contacts byrelationship so in groups.Thesecan be groups that you definealthough it could be sort ofsystem catchall group, soother Contacts is the group thateveryone falls into like acatchall group when you don'tadd them to a group of your ownso if you haven't added intoyour favourites or to a teamdown here or subgroup that youmay have created so I've createda couple of groups down here5SUR5, and a team group and so on.So if that falls into thatbracket.Then they're going toother Contacts and you can alsohave people edit yourfavorites list.So from these usersI've got listed below.Some of them are selected and added to my favorite list, as well.So theyappear at the Top here, sothat's groups, but sorryContacts by group.The status means that they've listed the same peoplebut listed in a different way.They start showing you those who are online.Those who are away.Those who are unavailable.Those who are are unknown, etc as welland the 3rd are unknown, etc as well, andthe 3rdOne is relationships.So when you see Contacts byrelationship.This is definedand determined by theirrelationship with you.As youadd them, as a contact to yourlist.So when you add them,You can say all their friendor family at work colleague anexternal contact, etc.So thisessentially you're looking atthe same information ofContacts, but in 3 differentways by groups that you defineby their current status.Youknow the availability andLastly by the relationshipwith you as a contact.You can also see on here aconversation history thatshows you recent calls chatsthat you've had who with therepresentation down the lefthand side, the icon representsthe type of cool.We knowwhether other type ofconversation was over instantmessage chat or a meeting or avoice or video call.That'srepresented on the left handside there and over here isany meetings again that you'vehad you can set up anymeetings.You got scheduledwill be listed in there aswell.OK to to start key instantmessage chat with someone youcan just hover over their picturehere notice.This is sort ofremote control option herecoming out, he hover over apicture.And you get thesebuttons that allow you tointeract with that user so sendan IM is message chat.Video sorry voice call videocall or view their contact card.So if I click on instant messagehere, you'll see we get hintsmessage window pops up.When wecan start obviously type in thestart chat with that user thatusers not currently online so wedon't need to do that.But youcan see what we can do fromhere, you can see that we canalso transfer files.We can alsoadd other participants at themoment.It's just the two of usin this list.We can choose addparticipants up here and thenselect other people to drag them to the conversation and then click OKto add them to the list.You also got the option of draggingpeople in so you can dragsomeone from this side over hereand add them as  a participantthat way to the list.I leave it as it is for the moment,so we got myself and Guillaume in thisconversation.Other things, Ican do from here.Obviously youcan see I can escalate this sowe may have been chatting abouta particular report.or evendiscussing or working oncollaboratively or we mightdecide we need to have atelephone call about it orperhaps a video call but alsohave the option of presenting soI showed you this one of theslides earlier so you can dothings like have notes or addattachments or co-author onoffice documents, but you canalso do presentation remotely so as topresent your desktop yourentire desktop an individualprogram or a PowerPoint file soif I wanted topresent a PowerPoint file andwork with it with Guillaumeor present it to him at least Ijust select the file click onopen takes a few seconds to loadup and then expands the window,so I drag the window across alittle bit.Let's see that nowuploading into the window.And then expand to allow us tothen view those slides.As I'm presenting that so I'mpresenting this to the otheruser, but it also gives us somecapabilities for collaborationin terms of production tools asyou'll see 2 things do thingslike highlighting and writing onthe slide and that kind ofthing, so I'm looking at theslides here and I can then gothrough the slide presentationas we chat over here in the chatbox discussing what's on theslide?What we're presenting andwe can see we've got someediting tools up here.For annotating so we can do youknow right text and highlightstuff and change the colors and?Size of the pen and that sort ofthing to highlight the thingsare working.We're talking aboutas we have our chat, so thisisn't the same thing as workingon in real time, collaboratingto file a power point file.Thisis just presenting it in ordersort of remote capacity todiscuss it and talk about andannotate as a slideshow ratherthan actually working on thefile directly.And then whenwe finished presenting we canjust stop presenting we'vefinished discussing on todiscuss and hide the stage ifyou go back to the smallwindow again and carry on aconversation and then whenfinishedJust click across uphere to close down thatconversation.And the last thing or 2 andhere's the couple of things onstatus that are up here.It shows yourcurrent status.So this can justbe you know what you're up to todayor I'm working from home today.For example, that kind ofthings, it's just sort ofstatus.Update of what you're upto and what you doing?Where youare, but also want to show theoptions up here.So you click onthe cog icon opens up variousoptions to Skype for Business,or some other general.Somepersonal so things like yoursign in address personalpreferences.How you want yourcontact list displayed you know... in what order...do you want this shown as active... inactive rather whenyou've been idle for 15minutes or do you want to bechanged from inactive to awayagain for further period oftime?There's options forchanging your picture yourphones how you receive alerts.IM options ringtones audio videodevices for collaboration for.Voice and video calls and soon, and other things as well.Like you know recording whereyou want to set yourrecordings and that kind ofthing.OK.So we just switch back to theslides again.So we saw in Skypefor Business how it canhelp us finalize the documentsremotely by using a very simpleand easy to use tool that getsus... Skype forBusiness, which gets usinformation about people'savailability immediately... are theyavailable right now.Can I makea chat session with them or possiblya voice or videoCall?  Itcould be escalated to a voice orvideo call and as part of thatconference voice or videoconference.You could beworking, collaborating ondocuments as attachments orco-authoring or presenting fileswhen presenting a desktopthat kind of thing.So those tools, we've looked atbrief in this session can help ussort of find and workcollaboratively with coworkers.Even if some of them aren't inthe same location as us or if they're in remotelocations or not in the officeso you could have several peopleworking on the same file  at the sametime with Real Timecollaboration co-authoring andyou can visually see who'sworking on what part of the file...Whether a Word or aPowerPoint file,  Excel etc.And you can see simplecommunication tools to havequick instant message chat.IM chats or to hold voiceand video conference calls andagainyou can as we saw wecould use those differentcollaboration tools andfeatures to collaborate withour coworkers.So Office 365 gives us a quickaccess to those tools fromthe Start menu on Online versions...Word online gives us thatcapability of co-authoringquick visual representations ofwho's working on the project at thesame time as us and what areathey're working in and thesecure versioning andmodification.And that Skype for Business is simpleto use, it gives us availabilityinformation, presence informationpermeated throughout the productand also allows us to usevarious production tools to workcollaboratively with ourcolleagues.So post-training...there are several post trainingresources available to you to furtherenhance your mood trainingexperience.You can view therecordings of previous webcastsessions.You can accessrelevant video tutorials.Youcan review usage scenariosprovide feedback on yourexperience as well, and you canalso access MOOC specific groupson Yammer for furtherinformation and to extend yoursupport and your experience.In that area as well, just wantto show you what the MOOC websitelooks like so you can go and look atthese post course resources.So here we're looking at a coursecalled how to communicate whocan help me for example, in theOffice 365 training site and youcan look at information aboutweb conference here when thenext available sessions are youcan review the webcast you canlook at usage situations.This little small video snippetsof those situations.So here'sthe MOOC website that make homepage.Showing all the differenttypes of online trainingresource is on the portal so youcan view all courses.You can do...you could look at courses just by usecase...Uh...

You can click on ""Newest""47and see that the oldest is coming first now.48You can click to get back to the previous order.49It is sorted by date but you can select to have it ordered by sender50or by whatever you prefer;51by category if you use categories...52if you select by from or whatever other ordering.53At the bottom, you have the possibility to show in groups.54This time, all the emails are grouped by sender.55If you right-click for example, on the header of a group56and select ""Collapse all groups"", you've got the list of all of your senders57and you see that some of them are in bold and with a figure58meaning that in this group there are some unread emails59and the figure indicates the number of emails that are not read in this group.60If I open, I can see with this vertical bar61that these 2 emails are still unread.62That's the same in this group: 7 emails are unread.63That's the first possibility to order by date.64If you check this ""Show in Groups"" option65you see that it collapses all groups and everything is grouped again.66Every emails are received normally.67Today no emails have been received, yesterday, Tuesday, Monday, etc.68It's very interesting to choose the order for the emails and show them in groups are not.69It's up to you.70Remember to right-click and collapse all groups to have all the groups collapsed71which is a cleaner view, I think.72That's one opportunity.73Here you have ""Unread""74where you'll see all the unread emails.75That's another option for organizing and ordering your mailbox.76You can still create new folders here.77Once the folder has been created,78to send a mail to this folder,79right click, ""Move"", and select in the list the folder where you want this email to be sent.80Or even easier: you drag and drop directly in the folder.81Now you find it here.82Of course you can send it back to the inbox.83So that is Outlook.84In terms of organization,85to tell you that you can right-click to have several actions.86Among them, you have the possibility to categorize your emails87with standard categories88that you can quickly change, rename, create new ones.89Then you will be able to, for example, give a category to this email.90In this case, this new icon appears in the list of emails.91If you open the email in the reading pane92Here there is a blue bar to show you to which category this email is related.93It's a few things to understand when you have lots of emails already organized and classified94or categorized, it may be interesting to have a very powerful search function95where you can select where the search will be performed:96the current folder, subfolders, current mailbox, for example.97It's very powerful because you don't need to enter complete words,98only a string of characters.99For example, if I write ""teach""100you see that the system is able to retrieve Teachoip for example.101If I select, everything with ""teachoip"" appears.102The search can be performed anywhere:103in the sender name, recipient name, in the body of the mail, etc.104When the search is performed you see that the string of characters is highlighted everywhere.105It may be the sender, the body of the email.106It's a very powerful search and you can use the field above the list of emails.107Be careful to select where to perform search108because if, like me, you have several accounts,109searching several inboxes may take several minutes.110Here are some possibilities for you to order, classify and organize your mailbox.111That was Outlook.112The other communication tool available in Office 365 is Skype.113Skype is available here.114Skype is a communication tool115which is included in Office 365116where you can find your name,117different possibilities with Skype.118The interest of Skype is that inside your organization119everybody can see your availability status.120Here for example, I'm supposed to be available,121but I can say ""do not disturb"", etc.122You can set your location if you want,123show your location to other people,124in this case you can say ""Home office"".125The same here : what are you doing today?126Working from home office, location: Home office.127""Show Others My Location"": if you uncheck this, your location will disappear.128The interesting thing is that all your contacts are available in Skype.129Groups:130the groups are delegates, other contacts, trainers.131By status: you have all the people that are online,132all those away,133when the system does know what their status is134and these which are unavailable.135Then you've got conversations,136everything that you have received:137meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, missed calls and all calls by phone calls.138If you have meetings, they will appear here.139What is interesting with Skype in terms of new ways of communicating that I was telling you at the beginning140is that when you hover over a contact,141some actions instantly appear through icons.142For example, you can send an instant message to this contact.143It's very interesting: instantly you know if the person is available or not144because Skype classifies and takes into account what's in the status field.145I know that Amaury will be in my favorites146but if I go to status, I see that Amaury is not available at the moment.147I can send him an instant message and he will receive a notification of 1 missed instant message,148but at this moment he will not be able to answer.149What is available through these icons, which is kind of a remote control?150You can send an instant message, you can have a phone call through Skype,151a video conference,152see the contact card153and with the 3 dots, you can even have more commands.154For example, schedule a meeting, continue a conversation, etc.155remove from contact list.156The interesting thing is that whatever the classification for your contacts157you instantly know, in terms of communication, which communication way you can select.158When I was telling you about reactivity159that's the point: instantly you can see the persons available and know if they are currently available for a discussion or not.160You can add people to your list.161If you right-click, you can add to contact list,162create a new group163or other contacts to an already existing group like this ""Trainers"".164Amarra is a colleague who is a trainer,165I added her to the trainers group.166It's very easy and you don't need to enter an entire name.167By entering a string of characters168the system instantly adapts and is able to retrieve people whose names contain this string of characters:169Amarra, Amaury, etc.170It's very interesting too171because if you select to start a video conference172you will instantly know if the person is available or not.173""Offline"" means that it's not possible.174Many possibilities are actually at your disposal175in terms of phone calls and instant messaging.176The interesting thing between all the communication tools in Office 365177is that the main ones like Outlook and Skype that I've just described178are very closely related.179There is an integration between both.180You remember the hovering over the contact that shows commands through icons.181If we go to Outlook,182the same will appear in an email, for example, if you hover over a sender or recipient.183You see that it's me, but that would be the same for anyone else:184I'm available and video capable.185Here I have the possibly to send an instant message to this person,186call him/her by phone via Skype,187video conference.188If I select someone else like Amaury,189the same will appear for whoever this is.190Each time there is someone191I know that he's offline192so there's no possibility to send him an instant message193but offline messages only.194I can get his complete card.195In terms of integration with Outlook,196even closer integration and perhaps even more interesting:197if you go to the calendar198in the calendar we will be able to create appointments, meetings199in your calendar.200There is a specificity related to Skype:201if you create a new meeting request for example,202you'll find,203once it is activated,204a button called ""New Skype Meeting"".205if you select this, a close relationship between Skype and Outlook,206in the invitation email, which is the normal way for scheduling a meeting,207in the invitation email, Outlook will automatically send a link208and any person receiving this email,209internally or even externally,210someone from another company, for example,211a vendor, a subcontractor, a client, a customer,212any person receiving this email will instantly be joining the conference213by clicking the link.214where I can use this conversation.215I have myself created a link and by clicking the link I enter the meeting.216Persons receiving this invitation mail, by clicking the link, will be able to enter a meeting with me217and this independently of the device used218because this link will allow the person to enter the meeting219with a PC, laptop and also with a tablet or a smartphone220even if it's not the most user-friendly way to enter a meeting.221But independently of the device because even if Skype is not installed on this device222there will be a way to connect with an application that will be installed in the browser on a PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone.223There is no need for the recipient of the invitation224to have Skype installed.225That's the quickest way to enter a meeting with anybody on earth.226In Outlook, click the Skype meeting button to create a link to send the invitation to someone anywhere in the world that will able to connect to the meeting.227You have 2 examples of communication tools included in Office 365 that will accelerate and facilitate your communication.228It will be a more reactive because if you need to quickly contact someone229inside your organization,230you will instantly know their availability, either through Skype or Outlook,231because if you have someone in the list of your contacts232you've got these 4 items to show the availability of the person to contact them.233You always have these possibilities here.234it's a new way of communicating, more reactive and flexible,235because you are not dependent of one way,236you can choose your way and, even with external people, you can instantly be into a meeting with these persons outside your organization.237These were the 2 possibilities: Outlook and Skype,238the relationship and integration between both systems.239That was a quick but interesting way to discover these 2 communication tools.240Thank you for attending this session.241I hope you can make the best use of it.242Thank you, bye.",2016,N/A,[],[],[],1472.0,webcast
890,en,Office productivity tools,117.0,"Hello and Welcome to this short training session on Office MOOC training.2These sessions are related to specific products and tools and this particular one is entitled ""Office Productivity Tools"".3My name is Stephen Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.4In this session we will introduce some specific Office 365 products that can be used to improve office productivity.5We will start by looking at OneDrive app in Office 365.6Then we'll discuss the online version of the Office suite.7Finally, we will look at the social networking tool for business, which is Yammer.8The goals of this being to identify those Office 365 tools that can help to facilitate office productivity9and also to have a look at some of the other resource available for this course in the curriculum website.10Before we look at these tools, let's have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.11Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft12that gives organizations cloud-based environment13for the communication with colleagues or working together collaboratively14and also for storing files and documents.15It provides organizations with a cloud-based mail service16by the exchange on online service, cloud-based communication service with Skype for Business online17and cloud-based websites through SharePoint online.18You also get online versions of your Office 365 applications: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.19You can access your Office 365 applications via a web browser on portal.office.com20and you can do this on all kinds of devices: notebooks, PCs, tablets, mobile devices.21This takes you to your homepage22where you can either click in the top left corner,23which refers to the start menu online or the Office 365 start button,24or in the homepage itself, you can click on the different tiles25to access various available services and applications26like Mail and Calendar in OneDrive, and SharePoint and the Office online suite as well.27Now let's take a look at that in our live online demo environment.28Here's our Office 365 suite29and we can see the tiles to access the various applications and services from here30like Mail, Calendar, OneDrive and SharePoint.31Online application suite: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote,32or possibily the Office online suite.33We can click in the top left corner to access the start menu34and have access to various tiles35This is the bottom within Office 365 to switch from application to application.36Rather than having to go back to the homepage to access the tiles37we can click on the start menu in the top left corner to do the same thing.38This is modifiable as a sort of launching pad39so if you want to change a tile, you can click on the ellipsis button to modify and choose ""Unpin from app launcher""40and then pin a different tile, so click on ""View all my apps""41and then we can select a different application.42If you want to add the Planner tile instead for example,43click on the ellipsis button and choose ""Pin to app launcher"".44If we click on the start button in the top left corner, we will find out that the Planner tile will be there instead of the Store tile.45To switch back to the homepage, click on the Office 365 link in the top navigation bar.46It takes us back to our initial homepage from where we logged in.47There are few options in terms of settings.48Click on the cog icon to open settings49and we can do things like modify the look, so we can change the theme.50There's a lot of different options, different colors and different types of themes51like circuit, cats, robots and bricks...52All sort of things.53Let's choose one of those: robots.54Then we can save that theme.55We can also do things like change our landing page.56Rather than access the default homepage,57if you want to access the mail app when you first log in the morning58we can do that, click on save,59and it will become our initial landing page when we first log in the morning and it will take us straight to our mail60rather than on this default homepage.61There are other settings as well: notifications,62language and time zone, change password, etc.63But that will be sufficient for now.64To switch to our applications, click on the start menu.65Click on the appropriate tile to open an application.66This is going to open our Mail application.67If you want to switch to the calendar for example, click on the start menu and on the Calendar tile68Switch to the calendar, you can notice that the theme, product, all those different components are both in the Mail and Calendar and in the People69which is already in our contacts.70We can switch to contacts and see what it looks like.71These are the contacts that we can modify and view in there.72Let's get used to moving around the applications in the start menu.73Let's click on Office 365 to take us back to the homepage again.74Then we'll switch back to our slides.75We saw that we can access the portal via portal.office.com.76We can click on the start menu in the top left corner to access all our application tiles77to get access to those applications and various services that make up the Office 365 suite.78Let's look at the first product about office productivity: OneDrive.79What is OneDrive? It's a storage location,80one of the storage capabilities of Office 365,81and gives you up to one terabyte per user82of storage space in the cloud in the Microsoft data centers.83So you can use the online storage capability to store your files84in cloud-based location services85and get access to documents to be able to view them for anywhere,86anytime you access to it, via the Internet on any kind of device.87You can also share your files with colleagues.88That makes it much easier to work collaboratively with other people, even when you're working remotely.89You can easily download documents, work with them offline or directly online in sort of real time collaboration.90If you select a file, as you'll see in a moment in the demo,91it gives you options on the menu to preview, open the document, to share it with other people92either by invitation or a specific link to the document.93You can also view those share permissions on that document as well.94You can download a copy of the document95and you can also view the version history of a document96if you want to open a previous version or delete or even restore back an older version.97Let's go and have a look at that in the live environment.98Back on our homepage.99We are going to open the OneDrive application, click on the start menu in the top left corner100and then we can click on the OneDrive tile.101We can also right-click on it and choose ""Open in new tab""102if we want to open it in a separate tab, which is what I'll do.103We've got a list of files and folders in a storage location, in the cloud.104We can use some buttons across the top menu to do things into our storage location.105We can create new files and folders.106I could create a new folder to store things in. We can create new documents: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, etc.107We could also upload files from a local computer108to this storage location.109We have a sync button as well. That's a sync online storage in OneDrive with a local drive on a local computer110so you could then work on a file offline when you are disconnected from the Internet.111Work on it when you're away from the Internet112and then when you get back online again later you can re synchronize those changes to the online storage location.113In terms of file: if I select a file,114select Document 3, for example.115I select it on the left hand side, so the menu pops up116giving access to various tools.117You can open that application118in Word online or in the full version of Word if we have it119We can share a document, get a link to it,120download it locally, delete, move, copy, rename121and also view version history for it.122Rather than using the menu across the top123you can also right-click on a document and use the right-click context menu.124Another way of doing it is to click on the ellipsis button (the 3 dots)125to open exactly the same menu.126Let's open Document 3 in Word online for example.127I can open the document in Word online.128This is ""Document 3 - saved"" in the status bar and you'll notice if I start to type in some text129it will change to ""saving"".130I could change it and it will automatically save it and say ""saving"" afterwards131because you're working on online documents132being saved in the cloud automatically133on the file as you make those changes.134If I click on the FILE menu135You'll see that there's no save option. There's a ""save as""136but there's no save because things are saved automatically on the file when you're working with them online137on these online applications.138You also have the option of editing in Word.139If you're using Word online for editing, you want to open it in the full version of Word140you have the ""edit in Word"" option which you can use to switch to the full app.141Let's suppose another person also wants to work on the same document at the same time, on another browser,142I've got a document available, Document 3.143If I use it, it also opens the same document in Word online.144In this case it opens in sort of read only mode145if he wants to edit the document. You can see the changes I've just made.146He can then edit the document again. His options are to edit in the full version or in the browser-based version Word online, which he's going to select.147Now I have 2 people working on the same document at the same time,148It pops up with a little icon149to show that someone else is working on the document150and it also shows us with this cursor whereabouts in the document they're working.151So far he is to make some changes here.152Let's change the formatting on that.153And so on, and then switch back to the other screen.154The other person sees those changes as well.155It tells me that User 2 is also editing the document156and I can see the flag there that shows you where abouts their cursor is part of the document editing.157It's a real time co-working and collaboration on that document.158The other thing we can do, let's close it down for a moment,159is share the document.160If I access the menu for that document, there is a share option there.161I can also do things like download it locally and work on it, move it,copy it, etc.162I'm going to share it with someone so I click on ""Share""163You've got 2 options for sharing: you can invite people to a list.164So you can select users from your directory165and decide whether they should have read only access with ""Can view""166or whether they can have change and edit access with ""Can edit"".167You can add a message to your invitation.168You can require them to sign in or access anonymously169and you can send an email invitation to let them know that the document has been shared with them.170You can turn this off if you don't want them.171Click on ""Share"" to share it.172It's already shared with that user so we just had to log in a moment ago.173The other option is to share with a link.174You can create a type of link: edit or view,175either anonymous or one that requires sign-in.176Let's say we want a view link with no sign-in required for example,177you can right-click and copy that link178and then paste that link into an email message179or to an instant message chat window or something.180The person that you're sending that too can click on the link and then they'll get the access181that's been determined by the level of link that you selected in the list.182You can do it more anonymously by supplying a link183or you can do it specifically by inviting a person and applying certain permissions to that document.184The last thing we will see is the version history.185I click on ""Version history"" and I can see a list of who's worked on it and when,186if there are any comments made on the document, changes, and so on.187I can use the list of versions to select a previous version188and view it, delete or restore it back again should I need to.189Let's switch back to the slides.190We saw that OneDrive is the storage location for these files.191It's to upload and store files, view and access them,192share it with other people as we did a moment ago.193Not only that, but it also allows us to access those drives194using the application.195In this case we were using Word online as part of the online Office suite196to access documents.197One of the benefits is that when you use the online version of the apps198and the Office 365 subscription199is that you always get the latest version.200So if there's been made changes to the version of the application201you will get those updates automatically.202If you've got the full Office suite, then changes made to those applications203you will also get updates to those versions as well.204Another benefit is you've always got access to it.205Wherever you're located, you can get access to those applications.206If you're in a hotel, remote office, at home or at the airport waiting or something207you can get access to Word, Excel: PowerPoint and OneNote online,208wherever you've got access to an Internet connection essentially.209Having those online versions, you can view and edit documents without the need for a local installation of the Office software210and you can use those built-in tools for enabling real time collaboration211in real-time co-working capabilities with synchronous co-editing with other users.212We also saw that not only does it let you do that collaboration but also lets you see a visual representation213of a visual indicator of who's working on the document and whereabouts on the document they're currently working.214The example you can see on the slide215is a screenshot showing a flag that opens up to show someone working on another cell in Excel online.216The last thing we want to look at is Yammer, the social networking app for business.217After after you create your corporate documents in Office online apps218you can store them in OneDrive and Yammer can help you collaborate around that content.219You can inform interested parties about updates made on document  by posting a discussion in Yammer.220Then upload the file for comments221and you could ask your colleagues to post comments about the document using Yammer conversation replies.222You can also use Yammer chat facility to have a quick chat with your colleagues about documents or projects you are working on.223I will show you in a moment, you can click the link to a document and open it directly in Yammer224and open up the relevant Office online application to work on a document225collaboratively with your colleagues.226as we saw a moment ago.227so you can access Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote documents from within Yammer and collaborate on them with your

891,en,Social networking tools,80.0,"Hello and welcome to this short training session on Office MOOCtraining.These sessions are related to specific products andthis particularone is entitled Yammer Enterprise SocialNetwork.My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer forthis short session.So, in this session will look at the Yammer social networkingproduct in Office 365.We'll start looking at how Yammer can be used to communicate andhow it can provide cool string and co-editing capabilitiesand finally how Yammer can be used to enable coworkers toparticipate in the creation of content.The goal being to identify that Office 365 tool for facilitatingand improving social networking.It will have a look at the restof the available curriculum tools for this course.But before we look at these tools that have a quickintroduction to the Office 365 environment.So Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft thatgives organization cloud based environment, not only forcommunication between the colleagues and for them to worktogether collaboratively. Also for the storage of files anddocuments. Office 365 provides organizations with a cloud basedMail service, so Exchange online; cloud based communication tooland service through the Skype for Business online and cloudbased websites throughSharePoint online.And also along with that, you get onlineversions of the Office application suite, namely WordExcel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.So you can access your Office 365 subscription by navigatingyour web browser to portal.office.com and this could bedone for all kinds of devices such as notebooks and PC's andtablets and mobiles.Listen take you to your home page or landingpage.We can either clickthe icon in the top left corner,which we refer to as the Start menu Online or Office 365 startbutton or on the home page itself.You can click on thedifferent tiles available to access the various services andapplications, such as my own calendar,and OneDrive and Sharepointand the online application suites; Office application suite.So let's take a look at that live online demoenvironment now.So here's a demo Office 365 environment tenant and you cansee we got our Welcome pagehere, so home landing page.We get access to the online applications.So you can see, wehave tiles here for Mail and Calendar and People,Yammer,OneDrive SharePoint, etc.Exceed also got tiles for the onlineversions of office applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.Let me click on the top left corner. This is our start menu;Start menu Online; or Office 365 start menu.We can click on thatagain.Get access to all those tiles so this is iaccessiblefrom wherever we are within Office 365, whereas these tilesare only available on the on the home landing page.So we'regoing to use the start button to navigate from application toapplication and again we can see the tiles there for thosedifferent services; those different apps.You can also modify that list, if you want to add or removetiles from this sort of launchpad here.We can clickon the ellipsis button.The three dots and choose to unpin that from the app launcher.For example, if weclick on ""View all my apps"".We can add tiles back to itagain.To get a list of all our applications.We can then selectagain.The ellipsis button to add a tile back. So for thatPower BI tiles back.We can click on that and choose pinned to app launcher.If we want to add in a tile that wasn't on therebefore we want to add the store tile. Again, click on the ellipsisbutton, ""Pinned app launcher"".If we now look on the start button.We""ll see those tiles are back onthere?And the store has been added as well. Said switch backto your home page.Just click the link in the Top navigationbar. Click on Office 365 takes you back to your home page.Couple things to shop here : we got the note.We gotta help menuhere.We've got notifications that pops up, and let you knowif your subscription to ending or if you got a new applicationavailable for example, down here, so that's allnotifications.We've also got settings on the cog icon. Clickon the cog icon.We can do things like change our theme, ourlook and feel for thistenants. There is a lot of different color themes as you can see,there, we've got some animated ones.I got some colorful,cartoon style ones, like cats androbots andLego bricks for example. Let's choose robotsand save that thing.And then we can also do things like modify our start page.So rather than landing on this default Office 365 home page.You can click on the drop down list and select anotherapplication.So perhaps you want to start in Mail.Let me log inthe morning in the Mail app.We can do that and make that ourhome page,or start page, when we login.It's also other options and there are things like notifications where they wantreminders and sounds.Also pack change your password and thenlanguage and time zone settings in there as well.OK and then to switch between applications aswe make click on ourStart menu in the top left corner. Click on a tile to openapplications such as Mail.And you'll see that that theme is sort of permeated throughoutthe product sits in the Mailpart of Outlook, as well as it isin the Calendar and thePeople apps as well. So if we switch to the Calendarfor example, click on start menu again.Click on the calendar tile.And we can see that same theme in the calendar there. And againwe can just switch from app to app using the start menu.up here.If you want to click on People to see a list of Contacts.OK, so it's just show you how we switch from application toapplication.You can use that start menuin the top left corner.If we want to get back to homepage, initial landing pageclick on the Office 365 link. It takes us back to that page.And see the bottom page,we get a list of recent documentswe have accessed as well.OK let's switch back to the slides for a moment.So we saw how we can access portal.office.com to accessOffice 365 tenant and click in the start menuin the top leftcorner to access ourvarious applications and services on the Top left corner.So let's have a look at the Yammer tool now that discussingthis session.We can look at in 3 aspects of Yammer for communication, forsort of co-editing, co-authoring andfor participation.So we can communicate instantly using aswell, see a little demo at the chat facility.There's a chatbox available within theYammer tool.We can alsouse the Yammer open office to look for topicsYou're interested inin sort of targeted automatic groups and communicate with our coworkers internally, using internal groups or withpartners; external partners; again who may have a common interestor common need or common project. Perhaps you're working on.You can then use Yammer post ideas and questions and discussions to ateam or group, as a post; as an update; to ensure each sort ofwide range of people who share that common interest; or need; orworking on the same project; or document issue for example.And maybe want to assist you. So let's have a look at that inthe live environment.So first off, we need to open Yammer, so we can either dothat, from home page.Let's get used to using the start menu upin the top left corner.I can click on the tile or a rightclick on it, and choose ""Open in new tab"" if I want to.And Yammer will load up.And we can see in here, we got posts or update.Some otherpeople for myself; from other people in my work group downhere, that we can scroll down and see.There's a few tools to look at in here, so you can... have a searchbox up here, let's you search fordocuments or people or groups.I could search particular person.That view andgood his colleague of mine.And hover over that person to click, and access their details.I can see, things that they've posted; any conversationthey've been involved in or images or files if they've posted it. Notice thatyou can send each other message. Using this button,I can unfollow orfollow from here as well.So I can click on that unfollow andthen re-click on to followagain.Yammersaid just telling usthat from now we'refollowing that user.Click on the home button to get back tothe homepage everywhere.We gotta search box here, so wecould use for finding documents, if we ever lookfor particular document types. Starts typing pass the nameand then you can see the document and access documentto select the document.From there, so let's click on thatto open up the main ""Mailling"" document.Ok, and we will look at this in the next demo in terms of co-authoring,and co-editing.So I'll go back to homepage.That's just showing how you can search for items in the search box.You also got an inbox there, so for messages that come in fromother people, messages from the system, up here in your inbox.And then you have a notifications bell here thatshows you changes in uploaded a new version of a document there.You gotta new follower...That kind of thing will appearin your notifications list on here.You will get a chat box down the bottom right corner.So I clickon that chat box shows you who's online.Currently, I can thenstart chat with them again as you notice.They has a hoverover them that pops up, with this sort of contact card.And we create groups and join groups and view our groups.These groups already created in here default group internalgroup this one. This is an external group.Good ambiance team.And within that group will be get conversation threads, there,maybe files uploaded as well.You can see the members are from this list over on the right youcan search the group and so on.And we can use these buttons down here to create group, soyou can createinternal groups so that's for collaborating withpeople inside your company. You assign it a name or just call ittest or something at the moment use that yet and it will justlet you know with that group names available.Not you canthen start to add people to the list.I started type in theirname at the most group members. You can decide whether it'spublic, so anyone in the network can access it, or if it's private :only approved members can access it people within the group.And you can also create anexternal group.So it's it's for collaborating with people whowork outside your company. Againyou can give it a name.Add people to the list.Set them from recent lists or startstyping theiremail address for example.And then create the group and do it that way again. We got public and private options as well for that.We can't set back to the slides for minute.So not only we can use Yammer for communication with internaland external people will using the chat facility with instantmessaging chat.We can also use Yammer as a co-editing, co-authoring tool.This allows us toinfom interested parties, but updates who made the documents,by posting a discussion.Yammer upload the file for comment.For example, you could ask people to comment on that document.You've seen conversation apply and conversational thread in Yammer.You can use the Yammer chat facility,we already saw before, to have aquick chat with some colleagues about those documents or projectsyou're working on. And you can also click the linkwithin documents have been uploaded to open in the relevantOffice online app. It could be that PowerPoint or Excel,OneNote or Word to work on the document collaboratively with yourcolleagues and that's what we see in a moment in in the demo.So let's see that in the live environment.So I could post an update to that external group that I created.Informing about a new document.So just saying ""Please add comments this new charterdocument.""And then I can decide to have them notifying so noticeit's defaulting to the team.I can also add individual people in there as well by clicking... clicking off the list as well.If I click on thepaperclip icon over here across the upload files,either files already been loaded into Yammer, upload afile from local computer, cycle them browse to document,selected document uploads : ""Company charter"" doc here.It gets loaded into the post and I could then postthat updates in that comment to my team.And then other members that team could then come in much thesame way.And then access the document.They can get click on""Download"" from here, they could add comments to that particularconversation thread.I could like it, they can share theconversation with other people either inanother person; posted another group or as a private message with someone.And they can do things like for view theconversation; stop following conversationsif you're already following it.And they can access the document itself, so they canclick on the document.Open up in Word online in this case, it's a Word document andthey're looking at it.We're on read only mode here.So just viewing it.They can download it, print it, download as PDF... They can alsoclick on the ""Go to file"" down in the bottom right.And from there, although getting better preview window, they canalso choose to edit the file.Won't show then open up that document in Word online,allowing him to start here working on that document, editing it.So one thing to notice here.It says documents saved to startto make changes to thatdocument.You see, this is saving very briefly then quickly saves it. So when you're working the online version of the documenthere in this Word document access from Yammer, you're updatingon the fly. So if you look at the file menu, we'll seethere's no save option as ""Save as""... There's no save optionbecause they're automatically saved this little reminder thattells you that.So you're saving documents on thefly as you work on them.So that also means I could also collaborate with other people onthis document as well.Let me just show you that in another demo.To switch to another machine for a moment.So for example, I could access this file here.This is a file stored in SharePoint light be.For example, it's a OneNote filelike and then open that up in a new tab or opening this...He's a one.So it used to this is I can open that document.And maybe I'm looking at it in sort of read only mode.This is a OneNote file. IfI click on edit and then I can get theoption over there, to use itin the full version of Microsoft.OneNote, or in the browser based version IE OneNote online.I'll select that option.So I can then start to add some text in here, there is ""User 2"".And if I switch across the other.Looking over here and then get..Yeah, they use to log in and access the same file.So it cames on read only mode, we can choose to edit in thebrowser again here.And as soon as I open that up, it says ""User 2""standard is also here like in the click on thatit says whereabouts they working if there's multiple pages orshow me which page.They're working on.Show me he's workingsomewhere on this page.And I'll see the changes that are they making to that documentas they work.If I switch back to the other useron the other page...You see that they also get the message that another user isworking somewhere on that page.You can choose the view authorsoption up here.Show authors to show which bits of contents mayhave been created by who and you will see the additional contentbeing added as you start to work on it in the online version.And as the page gets refresh, you'll see that content thatwe're adding beingadded to the page that I can have both seethat ""User 1"" and ""User 2"" content on the page.So you can havesort of real time collaboration.I guess it's respect the slides aren't it?So we've seen how we can use Yammer for allowing other peopleto sort of contribute and create documents, other documents, and byletting him co-author on documents.But for lock documents, you can also use it byasking people to participate.As well as sort of contributing co-authoring onthe document by ask him to perhaps add comments about thedocument as a conversation replying Yammer thread and youcan also create polls to obtain feedback on topics; oron documents; or projectsyou working on, related to yourteam or your project. So it's about quick look at that inthe demo.So I remember we uploaded that charter document America and askpeople to add comments on that new charterwe're doing. Createdthat in there and we post the update in MBS team groups. If we switch to the other user.And I remember his team, this is John Doe, the ""User 1"" dot standard.He can then reply to thatconversation, perhaps within additional information saying :""I think you needto change the intro or something?""So they can post comments that without makingchanges, the document.If you're not going to allow them to, ifyou've locked the document for editing.You could just askmembers of the team to make comments about the document andthings they would suggest changing on it or approving itor whatever. Or they could perhaps makes changes, downloada copy, make their own choices, and then upload those changes.So you can review the changes.They've made to their copy ofthe document that kind of thing and they can just post thatas a conversation. And gradually as people addmore and more replies that that thread of conversation ofcomments that builds up for that particular document,we've uploaded into the Yammer team group.Other people can also share that conversation again, sothey could share that to another group for example, nowthat all the company or a team and then say mentionedsomething at the conversation; sharing other people; they cansend as a private messages to someone, as well to have themreview that this comments or look at them and recommentthemselves for example.So every now switch back to the other user and then lookat the under any other it conversations.We can see that new comments.That's been added thereAgain, if we go to ""All conversations"" viewwe will see that in there as well.And when it is updated and who by and so on, you couldand then write a reply to that and say : ""OK thanks""into it, for example.And start to build up in a thread of conversation threadrelating to comments on that document, or that project you'reworking on for example.So you can also create polls to obtain feedback on topics ordocuments, or your team, or project.So I can click on pole here.Ask question in it.Cause this doc need more work and then I could provide a pole.And then I could send that to my team, or I could invite otherpeople individually to that, and then post that as a pole.Within switch back to the other user, you see a new update, so we'vejust seen the addition of thatconversation thread, saying ""OK thanks, I'll look into it"". Now,we got also this poll.that's appeared as an update. So wecan say  :""Does this doc need more work ?""We think it ""needsa small change"" for example, we can then vote on that.Change a vote if you want to as well, and then share that withsomeone else as well.So lots of tools we have been there forcollaboration, and participation, and co-authoring, within theYammer tool.Let's just go back to the slides.So the Yammer tool we've looked at briefly in this session can helpyou to improve communication, participation,collaboration withyour colleagues, or partners, or working online. Office 365 itselfprovides quick access to the Yammer app by the Office 365home page.Or the online start menu.You can use Yammer forcommunicating with coworkers and external partners within groupsor using the instantly with thechat tool.You can use Yammer to post updates about documentsor projects unityyou're working on, and then reviewreplies in that conversation thread relating to document or project.You can upload copies of relevant files in yourYammer post, so team members can view that document, comment onthem in the conversation thread. Also even open the links to thedocs, open work on them in the online version of theapplication and possibly also collaboratively in co-authoring mode.And lastly, you can use Yammer from your browser toparticipate by adding replies to commentconversation threads, orby responding to polls to get feedback from yourcoworkers, your colleagues, about a document or projectyou're working on at the moment.Now there are several post training resources available toyou to further enhance your MOOC training experience.You can review therecordings of previous webcast sessions, accessrelevant video tutorials, review the usage scenarios situationsand provide feedback on your experience. And there's alsoaccess to MOOC specific groups on Yammer for further information.And to extend your support of the MOOC environment.I'll just show you whatthat home pagelooks like on the MOOC portal foraccessing those webcast and training video resourceson this Office 365 live online training portal home page.So you can browse courses by use case,by products on the use case for things like ""communicate"",""share"", ""collaborate"", ""search"", ""produce""; products : ""messaging tools"",""collaborative tools"", ""Office productivity"", ""Social networking""...And then under ""Getting started""you gotta section for Office 2016, Outlook,Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and then Skype for Business and Sharepoint as well. And then when you find acourse you can click on it.The also progress currently on that courseyou can look under the course menu to seeresource is like when the next web conferencesessions are coming up.View recordings of the previous web cast.Review use case situation videos.And of course access for the tutorials for the products relatedto this course. In this case, things like Outlook and Skypeand Yammer for this particular course. And you can also accessthe group discussions linked to go and log into the Yammer Group, and...collaborate and participate, and participatediscussions with other people with a common thread in terms ofthat course they've attended.So that concludes this short session, I'd like to thank you for your attention.",2016,Beginner,[],[],[],1467.0,webcast
892,en,Collaborative and storage tools,110.0,"Hello Welcome to the short training session on office make training. These sessions are related to specific products and tools and this particular. One is entitled Collaboration storage tools. My name is Steven Ryan and I'll be your trainer for this short session.So, in this session will introduce some specific Office 365 products that can be used to facilitate collaboration online storage will start by looking at the OneDrive app in Office 365 for cloud based online storage and then we'll discuss SharePoint sites in Office 365.The girls being to identify those Office 365 tools that can help to facilitate and simplify collaboration online storage. But if we look at these tools that have a quick introduction to the Office 365 environment.Office 365 is a subscription service from Microsoft. That gives organizations cloud based environment, not only for communicating with colleagues and working together collaboratively, but also for the storage of files and documents.Office 365 provides organizations with cloud based mail services through exchange online cloud based communication services through Skype for business online and cloud based websites through SharePoint online. The subscription also provides online versions of the office application. Sweet word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote.You can access your Office 365 subscription by navigating the web browser to portal dotoffice.com and this could be done for what kinds of devices such as PC's notebooks tablets and mobile devices, etc.And when you look at it takes you to your home page or learning page where you can either click in the top left corner. The icon on top left corner, which you often refer to the start menu. Online as a sort of launching pad for various applications or on the home page itself. You can click on different tiles available there to access the various services such as mail calendar OneDrive.And also the online office applications like word, and PowerPoint and so on.So let's take a look now that live online demo environment.So here we have an Office 365 subscription on the home page. Of this Office 365 tenant and we can see we got access to various styles hours to use various collaboration tools in office online.You can see here we got tiles for mail and calendar and people and also tools like Yammer, social networking tool. OneDrive share point sites and also we can see tiles for the online versions of the office applications such as word, and PowerPoint and Excel and so on in the top left corner have start button or I start menu on.Again, the access to all the various tiles available for the apps. We have and this is accessible from wherever we are in Office 365 not just smiling page. But from over. I can click on that button in the top left corner to access these applications. You can also modify this launch page. If you click on the 3 dots, which is the ellipsis button you can remove.Tiles from this app launcher. This start menu. Button you can pin them for example, and then pin something else, there instead so we click on view all my apps.We can select a different tile different applications. So perhaps the store. For example, we could then pin that there instead click on the ellipsis button choose Pinta app launcher.And then when we click in the top left corner will see that the store tiles now headed to start menu launcher instead.Will take Office 365 to get back to the landing page start page.From here, we can see you got access to notifications that pop up on here help menu and then we click on the cog and we can see we have settings. So we can do things like change the theme the look and feel of this environment.So we could do a lot of different options here for circuits and cats and robots and tiles and all sorts of things select brick.Theme save that and we can also do things like modify the start page. So if you want to start in your mail application. For example, rather on this home page. This default homepage. We can select that in the drop down list click on save and the next time we log in how it will be loaded up on to the mail application. Start there rather than this home lending page. You can also modify.Medication the change password and choose language and time zone settings, there as well. But that will be sufficient for the moment if you want to select your apps. You can have the second on this landing page or you can click on the apps in the tiles up here.Click on a tile to launch applications such as mail order then open your mailbox. You'll see that theme is available here and permeates through the product again. If I click on that. I'll again and choose Canada tireless time will see the calendar app. Open up in outlook.When again we can see that theme is there as well.And there's a calendar OK will switch back to the home page again.And then revert back to the slides.So we saw how we can access the portlet portal dotoffice.com. How can access the tiles on the landing page. Home page and also access all the tiles available via the top left corner button start menu. Online tracks sold our applications and services from there.Let's you wanna look at the first of the collaboration tools. We want to discuss in here.And this particular session, which is OneDrive.So you can use the online storage capabilities of OneDrive and Office 365 to access your documents for anywhere, anytime oversee from a different from multiple different device types and this makes working collaboratively much easier even when you're working remotely. So it's easy to do things like downloaded document to work with offline or you can work directly with it online.Caperatus coworkers and colleagues in real time, using real time collaboration tools and Co. Authoring tools within the office online applications.And when you select a document or right click on a document to access the menu for that item. There's lots of things you can do in terms of interacting with that document you can open it, either in the online version of the full version. You can share the document with other people. By using invitations more by supplying with a link to the document will see how to do that in a moment in the demo.As I mentioned collaborate document in real time, so I could show multiple people working on the same document and see information about the other people working in the document where they are what the name is in the ugliness. You can view and modify the permissions on a document download local copies of it, then you can also restore the version history and view the version history of older versions of.I will see all that information in the demo is just coming up shortly.So when you share documents with people are those people automatically notified if modifications made the document as well. So when you share it with other users they'll be made aware of changes once you make those changes to a document.So it's going to look at that in the live environment.So from our home page. You can either select OneDrive. From here, we can select the tile for OneDrive.In this case, I'm going to right click, it and choose open new tabs or so have a separate tab open with that on it. So we can see it's their title does OneDrive for business. This is the corporate version of OneDrive.And we could see who could list of documents and folders and so we can create new documents directly in this location. So I can create folders. I can create word Excel PowerPoint OneNote files directly in this location. I can upload files from my local computer as well, using that play button to add them into this on OneDrive cloud.And you'll see also have a sync button here that allows us to synchronise this OneDrive without other local.Folder on local computer so you can take files offline work on them and come back. Online again later on re synchronized to keep those versions in sync with each other.And to work with documents got a few options. You can either select the document radio button on the left hand side like so and then a menu appears at the top that let's you perform various actions on it like open that document in either the online version of the office suite or the full blown version, we can share the document get link to it.Really delete move copy except to rename and also look at version history. We have those same options available. When we right click on a document file right click on that document will see the same options available in this context menu and also get exactly the same options available when it click on the 3 dots. The ellipsis button. You can see the same options available there, so you can see that we can open as he said.Can share it so let's have a look at sharing it first in fact? What these are open a document in word online first so you can see that loading up mode online now.And one thing to straightaway working online version so it says appeared document 3 saved so as soon as I start to type in this document. You'll see that changes to say saving and then very quickly or change today saved again.Everytime make a sort of change that document or just say saving them very briefly and switch back to saved again. So you're saving documents automatically hence for farming. You'll see, there's no save option as a savers. But there's no save option because documents are saved on the fly as you work with them, using the online version.Stored files.So we can open it as I said there let's switch back to OneDrive you.We sorrow civic do things like download it and so on, but we can also share it so I click on share.I can share it with different people so I can share it by using an invitation here, so select user user 2 standards. Another demo account. I can choose whether they're allowed to have read only access to it using can view or they're allowed write permissions on it by choosing can edit I can add a message as well to send them as part of the invitation.Requirement to sign in rather than using accessing anonymously and I can send an email invitation to that user that let's them know that documents been shared with them. So when I click on share on that document be shared with that user.Just says that they are updating one items that's being shared now will see that changes from saying only you to see user 2 dot standards. That's now shared with someone else. If it says only you then basically the document isn't shared it's just you. That's able to see it locally only.The other way of sharing it and if I go back to click on share again is to share viral link. So I can use the link to share it with someone so rather than specifying a particular person inviting him specifically with invitation. I could just create a link so that could be a view link or an edit link and it could be one that requires sign in with the corporate account or one that doesn't say.Link with no sign in required for example, you can select that click on create then generates a link and that link can be copied somewhere so we could then select that right click, and copy it and then for example, paste into instant message chat window in Skype or into any message or something like that, and then post it off too.So they could access that link and then when they sit view that link they'll be able to access the document based on the privileges of signed in this case would be anonymous access. But we just view only so read only access in this particular case.So able to share it anyway with that with that user so if we switch over to.Another browser is the other user just minimize this slightly.So over here in a different browser have logged in as another user so on here. I'm locked in as user one DOT standard. Or she's actually John Doe.And in this other.Browser here, I'm locked in the user to the one that we just shared the document with a moment ago, so we can then open up OneDrive on this.Our subscription here's we click on file showed me this has happened to French menus. That's being used on a different demo. But we click on shared with me partager back. Mark and see documents that been shared with me that you're going to finish. That view to see the recent documents that been shared.And we should see our document 3 document. We just shared there. It is just been modified recently and shared by John Doe, which is high user one account.And I forget the Tower of the users already in that side that document and just edit. It modified it. So we can now also open it as a different user so I choose that on there and choose open with word online.You'll see a couple of things appear straight away, so in this in this mode in as user tube. He's been accessing as a share, I could decide whether I want to.Edit that document and argues editing word either full of version of word or can I do it in browser?Let me say it allows us to start editing the document and you'll see that as soon as I do that pops up, with a little notification here showing me that another user ID John Doe is currently working in the document shows me where he's working with this little flag and there's also a tip that pops up. In this power at the top to show me where he's working on it as well, and show me editing online similar if I then stop.Changes to this document and switch back to the other view will see that that user is also flagged as working in that section of the document and that their editing that document from there, so we see we got real time. Coauthoring and collaboration by virtual factory using online applications to access these online files stored in OneDrive.And that we can see with fresh but he was editing, it and we can see a flag that tells us where the writing it.OK, well, just close that document down in that browser switch back to the other view again.And go back to OneDrive and the last thing to see in here is the version history information. So if I going to click on the ellipsis or right click on it, and choose version history or access it from the menu. All the same thing that shows us our version history fact document so you can see who's been working on it. When how many versions. There are a lot of ideas the size change.Comment made on that particular change and we can also use these drop down lists in here to look at the previous version, so you can view that previous version, we can. Delete it and we can even restore back again. If you want to restore back. A previous version of that document rather than the current one, so that's version history, you can see within every document stored in here.Getting on the document type you select it's a word document your options open in word online or word whereas if you select a PowerPoint document your options change to choose to open in PowerPoint and PowerPoint online.I can switch back to the slides.So we saw how OneDrive can be used as a storage location. We can upload files. We can create new files in there. We can synchronize with the local directory on drive directional local computer and we can see which documents are shared with who we can share documents download them get copies of them look at version history and also work in real.Other authors multiple offers simultaneously on the same document.So the next time we ought to look at is SharePoint and SharePoint sites in Office 365.So we can use Internet sorbas sites in SharePoint as part of the Office. 365 subscription to allow us to work in teams storing and sharing files again. Co editing a document simultaneously sylvanas how we saw in OneDrive and they contain these sites contain these like document libraries and lists and.To work collaboratively online and also to get version history as we saw in OneDrive as well.Let's have a look at that in the live environment.So I'm use a slightly different Office. 365 subscription for this just got some content already in their sub sample sites so again I can access the SharePoint sites by clicking on the tile in here or I can use the start menu. Button appeared to click on share point again. I'll open up. But in new tab.I can see some sightseers about it to type the following all recent you sites. I'll click on the team site so you can see in here we got.Recently used sites frequently sites we can also add them to favourites up here by clicking on these buttons to follow them and then not be listed at the followed sites up here. So it's like that, once like that one. They'll be added to following list and then we can select them. From there, we can separate from the bar in here.So let's let the mbi S team site.You can see we got some documents already loaded into here, so a similar there will be stored in OneDrive, you get access to different tools up here. So you can create new documents into this document folder or library. You can upload files from your local machine to hear you can use this to sync with local copies stored on your local computer and then.Wow, you can access to the same sort capabilities of sharing files again using the invitations or links of actually going to share their you'll see that and if I recall more you'll see the same type of Dropdown. List the contact spend that we saw in OneDrive. Similar you can do the same thing by right clicking all document get the same menu and again by clicking on the 3.This button what's different with this one is it's laid out slightly differently, and you can also get a preview. So when you right click a document. You just get the standard menu here. When you click on the ellipsis button here in SharePoint sites. You get a preview of that document in this window. You can open the document. From here, you can share it. Follow it and also when you click on this ellipse button again, you get those same options.Click on the document down here, so again if I do something like share the document will see we get the similar options before invite people in here by entering their names.And then decide where they want to give them read write sort or edit rights as well.But they won't send any learn Invitational. Not so very is very similar. It's not quite the same dialog box are very similar to our box to what you see when you're working and sharing documents in OneDrive, so that's the one option, inviting people that way, and similarly we can also use the get link option to create links again. They can be anonymous or corporate links and they could be view already links.And as I said, before you can do the other stuff as well. You can open the document again. The same thing that would apply if we open this document in word online and work on it online. We can use real time. Coauthoring with other people simultaneously. We can get download local copies of far one again. We can also look at version history file.In much the same as before.And again, you options for viewing delete again, restoring that her version back again.Can I preview different on here for preview a slideshow again. You'll see that many view of that slide share presentation in the preview window. Let's actually move through the slides even in the preview window.OK so let's head back to the slides again.So much to say mostly sort of OneDrive, you can use these SharePoint sites as a collaboration tool, a collaboration environment for storage of files.To get access to other people shared files to share files with them upload files synchronized with local machine preview documents open them access them coauthor them and look at the version history.So these tools have briefly looked at in the session can help you to share and collaborate with your coworkers on documents. Both online and offline Office 365 itself gives you access to those applications by the landing page. Start page or online start menu.OneDrive provides that cloud based storage location for files. They could be shared with coworkers and we saw that from OneDrive, you can open documents in the full office version of the application or that the online version of the app. Both viewing Android editing purposes. That includes working in real time collaboration with colleagues on the same document simultaneously by using those Co authoring capabilities that we saw.We're working with online files stored in OneDrive or in a document library in SharePoint. We sort of moment ago and you can use SharePoint sites technique create team sites upload and share documents with your colleagues and again use that real time, Coauthoring to collaborate with colleagues on documents stored in SharePoint Document Libraries.Now there are several post training resource is available to you to fold enhance your mood train experience.

And here again on the file system on the web can see either through documents of these documents now show.The group, so.Second, possibility, the news in outlook that are open outlook. The first change in our cook by the changes that outlook are mainly mainly based on new charts and maps so the very first one, is new one which is based on.Maps now when you create a table based on geographical data, meaning continent countries counties regions Postal code. The system is able to get'em in that you are dealing with geographical.Region and when you go to the insert tab. You know that the again. Then then you are the tax in Office, 2016, which is nothing new so the ribbon here. You've got recommended charge so you have caught the recommended chance, but goat.Is something cool not?And now you can slipped and that and you see that the system has been with chief all the first continent, but the countries to our GIS here China Canada, the us of course president.Speech the chart as usually you can have and you can of course. For example, ask for data labels that change the region and changed the style of course game.You are at the disposal everything that was available or is available with different charts. But these new so now you can completely have much.Better way to show your table into.Map world map are only just figures the data where only for Europe on Europe could be displayed if it's on the Mary calf calls America only. Display the system is able to determine from which region that will work, the data come from and to adapt and cream.Accordingly, that the first possibility to stick and one is something called hierarchical chart if again. We go to insert and request recommended charts. So here again list of recommended chart based on what the system excel things should be correct for your.Display off your data but if you go get into old chart. We found at the end, something you scold Sunburst and if you select Sunburst. You see that this is a new kind of chart, which this time is based on hierarchical.Data so this is totally new was not available in the password. Of course again. The same features you can change the design of the charts, OK, but and of course, OK, you can decide let me change into the gym charge title well. Everything is available to you as much as.You are the charge, but this one last one available is when you have that use the system is now able to determine.Um 3, so that you don't you don't go to insert but you could data and data at the end of the ribbon you find something called forecast sheets and now you can get a forecast complete forecast for your figures values so here.Nice forecast if I.Select today with you now you see that there is 3 figure. The first one, and the table has been increased and with new values added which are the forecast based on your first value and you have not 3 possibilities. The very first kiss when you the upper.Don't point, meaning that that space on the US. Most confidence and the figures and you think that based on where the past values. The system seems that if we consider the best possibility that would be the point of the upper confidence bound here, the lower confidence.The value is inserted in this exception here and of course to the forecast for based on the values provided so these again than you.And you a new charger. It's not directing insert tab as it normal chart. But it's the forecast sheets and not only the chart. It still so sheet where the system has been able to collate forecast genius, so if now you select a point to see that the.Changing and step through the date and of course, but you act like you can change when you create you can give options to have different options. Display in table and in the charge itself.That where the news inside of from Excel the last.News in Excel is something completely new is the possibility for you to record.To record sorry an what's going on. On screen for that. You don't go to search oh, but you go to the insert tab where of course, you can research. Lots of things that you probably knew pictures online features. It's attracted many things where I already added.And improvements of of PowerPoint, but this time at the end, you put something a group of actions called media where you would be able to research videos. First um would you record audio you can record what I'm saying here for exam?Um.So it's recorded twice in fact, one for the webcast and one for the one for the PowerPoint so I said, OK, and here you see. Now that there is a newer and you added icon with and and and you can hear press the sound so again you can record sound.The third possibility, which is also available. You can say you have the possibility to record what's on screen so you just save it. For example, that you want to record everything that is going on. These days and and in 3 seconds, the system will Rick.Then sing.And, of course was going on on screen so that's each remove.In link at this cancel and so now by Chris.I stop the recording and if I go back to.Night.Document I have now works as being green on screen so recorded and again played back here play impose web so video that you can include Tabrizi into a PowerPoint and that's a video coming from the recorded.Uhm screen so you can now record your screen, and insert it directly into you PowerPoint.That was the.Main knew in.PowerPoint.So now let's have a look to the changes that I've been the black by Microsoft on all.The applications of office of nearly all of them. The main characteristic got back here is that now. You can of course share you don't. But you can collaborate with other.On these documents and not only can you share this document collaborate of course on the?One by one faces, but also you can or you can.Share it.With other person said, but also you can edit a document at the same time.So.I want to share this document with.Someone.And for sure.To Britain would be able to?Cause received a message here.And the person able to correct.Thanks document is course online when you kick the shared document is suppose either. That meant already another. The system will ask you too.Save it online and once saved the person would be able to Todds presentation, but Eddie presentation online and you can cook edit document?I think that.So if I say.The system is updating.Goodnight.Person would be able to.Work at the same time.Open.And you see it in here now, meaning my.The person who is able to work on the instrument. You can see here that I am also working on this document in the right upper part says that's the person I've shared with here is trainer. One also modify the document with me that at the same time now.25 here I am on my computer and you can say that the other person is working and the other person is saying that I'm posting working so we can now work.Get up and of course I can even.Change and if and when are and you see I have had it recent? List audio and you can see that also my colleague? Is able to see the changes. So here process. It stage and in a few months. I have also process exchange.Separately, we can cool edit say document with no problem. Just a question of of sharing documents and waiting a few seconds. Caesar changes because of the Internet connections and and the server settings, but you can see that really maybe we can at the.On the same document and instantly or nearly instantly the the changes are taken into account back. The system and at anytime. I can see who's connected because I asked here you see here it says that the other.If you think flight 2.And I can see it so text free the way true.Anne to share documents, but also to work together on the same document related to that there is a new feature when you have shared the document. Here, there is new, I can related to the activity if you click there, you get the complete history.3 of the activities that have appeared on this document so you can say China once at the file. There's an open version, etc, etc. And if you select the Patch recursion, you can.Restart the best version is also contacting the server for information and you will be even able to restore a past version, so very, very important, and new collaborating you see here security warning references to external media.OK, so I can enable the contact, but just before below. Previous version to make this press previous version become the latest version 3 storage effectively store would be the next new version and online because it's unknown. All versions averages did at anytime you can reverse tour another.So if you don't need that just close until my next last version and if I go to my colleagues. You can see that the S that have uh that realization has been added also so it's a question of a few M seconds. One minute, depending gain on the Internet connection.It's very, very, very important feature of Office 365 and Office 2016 because now you can work online and at the same time on and on a computer with the Office 2016 version installed and at the same time you can work together on the document.One of the most version that you can unfix available.This is available on all.On all.Documents because if I go to Excel I have also this share.Uh button and here I have the activity to see the activities also so if I click on share and share also this document with my click that what we have seen with PowerPoint is also available out there and if you go to.Work amount which is not.It's exactly the same show you nevertheless I would do that.If you open the document.Thank you just shoot that, the same.Uh the same.Is available?Here, I have to share and then you have the activity available also so I can share this document and again work at the same time on the same document other from a computer or online depending on what's my need the next possibility feature that is shared between all the applications.Open word it's something which is called?

period?8Here is the plan.9First, we will discover one of the main new features of Office10because it's now available in the Office applications:11the “Tell me what you want to do” field.12I will show you how you can use this to question Outlook in particular.13Then we will see another new feature which is the Meeting Poll Reply.14Then another one, which is using the @ in the body of a message15to call the attention of someone16and to add its name to the recipients.17The last thing we will see is how you can keep the Outlook add-ins open.18In the past, you could not keep them open as you were working with the Outlook add-ins19or you were working with Outlook, now you can keep your add-ins open while working with Outlook.20The objective of this session is to discover some of the new features that will help you work faster and easier.21Let’s go directly in Outlook.22Here is Outlook.23You know Outlook with all the messages that have arrived.24In the past, when you needed help from Outlook or any other Office applications,25you used to go to ""Help"".26Now there is something much more user-friendly, which is close to what you could get from Cortana in Windows 10.27This field is at the end of the tabs list.28You will get something called “Tell me what you want to do”.29There, you just need to put something.30For example, if you write ""add-in""31you will get a few already prepared answers.32At the bottom you get help on add-ins.33If you select ""get an Office add-in for Outlook"" for example,34to learn how to get an Office add-in in Outlook,35by selecting this option, at the far right of your screen36a new help window will appear to show you how to get an Office add in for Outlook.37You may even find small videos which show you in practice how to perform what you asked  this field ""Tell me what you want to do"".38It's very powerful and useful.39If you select another word, for example ""increase""40you see ""get help on increase"":41""Change the font or font size in the message list"".42The system will propose you something related to the topic that you are looking for:43""Increase"".44If you select ""Change the font...""45on the far right you get a new help window46that will show you how to increase the font,47the size of the font48for sent or received emails.49This is the first feature which is very helpful and useful50that I used many times: ""Tell me what you want to do"".51It works contextually and a bit like Cortana52trying to extract from the words you used what you need exactly53and what you want to find.54Sometimes even when it is a function,55I'm thinking of the other Office applications56which also provide this field,57directly create the functionality you are looking for.58Remember: ""Tell me what you want to do"" when something you don't know how to perform, ask Outlook with this field59and it will tell you exactly how to do this.60This is the first feature.61Another new feature which is quite useful in Outlook62is the Meeting Poll Reply.63What is it?64I will close the search.65When you get a message from someone66For example, I received a message with 3 attachments67but that's not the point here.68You may want to propose to discuss the topic of this message,69to propose a meeting.70Instead of going directly in the calendar to find a place to meet and send an invitation71there is something much easier proposed in Outlook 201672which is called ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".73In the Home tab, at the end of the ribbon,74you will find at the very far right75something called ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".76It will look for you and try to propose a meeting to the sender.77Here you can change the duration of the meeting you are going to propose.78You ask for just work hours.79You can change the time zone.80There you see all the proposed timings for you and the sender of the email81to whom you want to send a time for a meeting.82If you select a time83you select it, click on ""Next""84and you see the selected times.85You can change the meeting settings.86Here notifications are off.87If you say ""Insert to email""88the system will create a new email89with the proposed time: ""You are invited to a meeting""90and you can now send this invitation91that will be an answer to the email you received from your sender.92By sending, the system will send this direct invitation to the sender93who then becomes recipient94and who will be able to select an option to accept or reject the meeting.95You can change and insert to the email that has been sent.96You can even have an online meeting with Skype,97which is an application included in Office 365.98This is completely new feature in Outlook 201699which is to answer by a request of meeting100directly in the email received.101That's the second opportunity, new feature in Outlook 2016.102Another one is that in the past, when you were using the add-ins in Outlook 2016,103the only available possibility was to either work within the add-in104or to work in Outlook.105So going back to Outlook would close the add-in.106Now you have the opportunity to keep the add-in open.107The add-ins are available in the Home tab,108at the far right of the ribbon109where we found ""Reply with Meeting Poll"".110Here is an add-in111""Customer Manager""112which is very used professionally to keep customer management efficient.113Here I have my add-in open114with many things that I can perform with this add-in.115I have selected the email from my sender,116I have created a contact in my customer manager add-in.117In the past, to get back to Outlook118I would have closed the add-in, just as I have done now119but in 2016, you can pin this add-in.120In this case you can now go to Outlook to create new emails121and you still have Outlook available on the right122and the add-in to create a new contact for example,123from the email that I have selected in my list of messages received in the past.124Now there is the opportunity to pin the add-ins directly and keep them open even when you're working with Outlook.125The next and last feature which is available126is a little bit different.127When you create a new email128you have the opportunity, many times used,129but with nothing concrete and practical to be found in emails in Outlook.130In the body of a message,131you can write anything132but you want to catch the attention of someone.133For that, add the @.134Just by typing @ in our message,135the system will automatically propose a list of people.136Of course, if you continue writing and typing a name or something137you can see that the list of people has adapted138and now you can select someone.139We can see that in the body of the message140the name has been added directly141but also in the recipients field142the name has been added.143Here if you can even remove part of the name144and you can continue to write down your message, etc.145It's very interesting to have this new opportunity.146Each time you write,147you can148write something directly in the body of your email.149Give instructions for example, to someone as you write your message150and at the same time, the people that you are writing to151have their names directly added to the recipients names.152This is a new feature in Outlook 2016153that may help you in working faster and easier154each day of the week.155In Office generally speaking, and specifically in Outlook156has a purpose to help you work better, faster, quicker and easier.157That was the use of some new features in Outlook 2016.158Thank you for attending this session.159I hope you will make the best use of it.160Don't forget to look for other Office 365 training sessions regarding Office.161Thank you.

896,en,Outlook 2016 - Discover the calendar and tasks,129.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training, which is part of the scheme ""Get started with office"". We will during the next few minutes discover the calendar and tasks in outlook so welcome again to this session. My name is Shepered, and we are going to spend the next.30-45 minutes together. Let's see the plan, the agenda what we're going to do during these few minutes first. 1st, we will discover the calendar and we will see how to create appointments.We will see how to create meetings and also recurring meetings.Then, at the end, we'll discover how to create a task and how to asign a task to another person but let's start from the beginning ; for that let's go to outlook here is outlook. Here is Outlook that you may know and here we are in the mailbox.Our mailbox general :I use it from there, you know how to get toCalendar at the left button part of the screen, you find'll a few icons. This one is selected because we are in the mailbox, then just here we can find the calendar icon which giveus acces to the calendar.Calendar, which is shown here.In the group of ""My calendars"" because as you can see here you may have several calendars available from this calendar. Part of outlook. If you have several accounts different accounts in outlook configured added.And you will have course, one calendar for each account that has been added to Outlook. So here I am in a calendar. You recognize of course on the left the folder panel individual view panel and up.in the window, you recognize your ribbon, which will give you access to a part of group of actions called ""New"" where you will be able to create a new appointment.Here we have a pop up window.Asking newe requesting information on the subject of the appointment.I'm meeting with human resource manager, I will give the location if I go at the end of the list I will find the previous location that I have used in my calendar, OK, so for example, here again at HRM's office.Which I will select and then youCan select the date for example, the 25th of January and the time.For example, from 10AMto 11 AMOK, so that'sMy appointment and if if this were a whole day event I can check the box ""All day event"" and in this case I know that my event there is no time range available now because it's considered starting at the biginning of the day and ending at the end of the day OK.If now I go to ""Save& Close""? I have my meetings. The uper part of the day of Wednesday out of the time range out of the timeline because again it is considered the whole day event. If I need to change thisicon, you double click to open it again and Check ""all day event"" and I find again. My time range from 10:00 to 11:00 that I can change if I want.Now this time rangethat we saved here and now I have my meeting on Wednesday from 10 to 11 and if I let my cursor over the item. I can see a little bit more detail with the Start and end time.And I can see the location and the reminder 1 hour. From there, I can just drag in the item. I can increase the time or of course, decrease the time range of my appointment, OK If I need again to change something or to edit the item. I just need to double click and here it is and I can again change the time for example, or if I need to i can create an occurrencethat'll repeat regularly so I have the possibility to put a starting time and ending time, the duration (1 hour) and then the recurrence current button, which can be daily, weekly, monthly.OK and if it is monthly or weekly. I can enter the number of the recurrence. If the recurrence is each week, or every 2 weeks whatever.Select the day of your parents of the occurrence OK and I can select the range of recurrence with no ending date by default.But I can say that there will be an end after just 5 occurrences or just select date for the ending and saying for example, that it will be the last day will be on Wednesday, the 21st of May 2017.If I click on OK and save and close the experience I can say here. The little icon that shows me that it is a recurrent item if I click to next week,  Nothing appears because it only occurs every 2 weeks. But if I go to next one proceeds to the 12 of february.I can find my meeting again with the human resource manager.on Wednesday, the 8th with the same timing because I have set the same time being, one hour.I get back to this week.So you can again if you double click on an recurring item. The system will ask you if you prefer to open just this one. This occurrence because you want to change just this one because for example, the human resources prefer to change the timing.11:00 to 12:00 save and close only these occurrence will be.impacted by this change and if I go to 2 weeks again my meeting is from.10:30 to 11:30, so you can select one occurrence and change it or if you prefer open the recurrence.And there is a button here. Edit series that you have. You change but this time for all series that will be impacted by you changesSo again double Change one occurrence or all the occurrences of these appointment.And, of course, if youYou can right click, and you have several possibilities never forget the right click, which is contextual. In fact and depending on where you perform this right click will get new menu that will give you a new opportunities to change.to edit.or to manage an item here for example again open occurrence or open the series I can have a quick print I can forward it to someone else.... don't forget the right click, which is very, very helpful, even more if you are a little bit lost in a new environment.So that's the way to create an appointment. So the appointment I remind you is just the indication that there is an event occurring to you, even if it's to someone else but only you is directly.Don't need to inform anybody else, because the other part is probably already aware of this appointment, so there is no need to send anything any invitation and information. Just you and that's all . Now there is another possibility to create in your calendar, which are.The Meeting :  the difference between a meeting and the appointment is that for a meeting, you have to invite to schedule a meeting (probably in the room)at least.Or anywhere, you have to inform and invite people to reunite to meet in a specific place together to discuss a subject specific material subject. Please note that just that, if you work on an appointmentOK.And if you click on ""invite attendees"" This appointment, will instantly change into a meeting or a meeting request.Otherwise, if you need for example, to create the meeting or schedule a meeting on Friday from 10 to 11 either You right click on this time range and select ""new meeting request"" or you select the time range and go to the ribbon.Then in the new option grouping you find new meeting you see this icon that indicates that all that people will be inducted by this meeting. So you click herethat will again request some information from you regarding this new request meeting request.So again we find the subject location start and end time, we can specify if it's an ""all day event"" even from there and you can select a start time again and an end time. The new thing is that there is a button 2 because this is an invitation.Sent to some colleagues probably, several colleagues that will gather a email requesting from them to decide whether they will assist or not, to be accept or reject the meeting or whatever the reason is.InThe global address list remind that if there is several accounts You have to select the relevant one or the people to be invited so here for example. I've got4 names the corresponding tothis name, so I can invite them.Now You haven't sent this meeting invitation no, but it is an invitation the subject.For example, ""Training reports"" and the location again, I can select from the past ones. Previous ones, or I have even here as it a meeting I will probably or the system supposes assumes that I will have we need.a meeting room so I have here the button rooms to select from the rooms.OK, the one that will be needed for my meeting.So now I have planned a meeting on Friday from 10:00 to 10:30 (grabs 30 minutes. I will get one hour) but from there It's impossible for me to know who is available and who's not ; Perhaps Sylvestreis available but perhaps not the other colleague? Perhaps the room itself is not available for that there is a function:In Outlook, which is called the ""scheduling assistant"".That will instantly give me access to the availability of all attendees and let me know if the time range is available for a meeting for all of us or if someone cannot be reached or is not available.During this time range. If I look at myWindowI can see that on Friday from 10:00 to 11:00 apparently everybody is available. On the contrary If I look at the previous date here, which is Thursday from 2pm to 3pm. I can see that at least 3 of my colleague, my attendees are (and I can see it at the bottom).They give meaning that it's not sure that they can be available for a meeting. So I can adapt my time range . For example, on Thursday, it could be relevant to have a meeting from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM becauseEveryone is available.So I can change my mind, and put it previously. If this roomWhere already booked by someone else, the same thing will occur I will see the room as being not available for this down range and I could also change the room for exampleOr try to find another date for this meeting again . for this meeting you could add here new persons.if you re click I can say yes, I need Pierre Skolil, OK and we see that here there is a meeting already booked from 2pm to 3pm by this attendee of course, as much as I did for the appointment.create the recurrence for this meeting for example, every 2 weeks againon thursday why not? I could decide to have no end date or just to say that it will end after 5 occurrences.And in this case again in my calendar this meeting will appear every 2 weeks until the date and the deadline is reached.Again I could change.the time here, again, I could add attendees here to have direct access to my global address list of my company or my organization, I could add rooms from hereSelect another one like one, here I can have several options. ""Show my only my working hours""  or many other things, and of course,If I go to ""Appointment"" instead of ""Scheduling Assistant"" I could even insert,And attach a filefor example, from this PC, or from this Recent documents.Or even my locations to find documents from groups or other application  for example, one drives or share point or siteor from other side, so I could even attach a file from the web.So now we can save it if I don't want to send it now and now here I have my occurrence. The next week, Nothing the next one,  Yes, because it's every 2 weeks now, I have myoccurrence if I double click on an occurrence they will ask me if I want to modify or change just this one of the enterprise series as much as I did put the appointment nothing new here, I can.Increase the time here for this occurrence without.Changing anything in the next level.And that's how I can creates both an appointment or a meeting. The difference again being that for a meeting you will invite or request schedule people to answer reply to your request of a meeting.That's how you can very easily create appointments and meeting. Now let's have a look to the last things that was planned for this session. The creation of tasks, which is  even easier. I mean than creating appointments for a meeting.But you have at the left bottom part of the screen this icon ""task"" where if you over this icon you can see all pending tasks, if you click on tasksyou get to the module where you will be easily create with the right click, When you task request for someone else or again in the ribbon on the left part of the ribbon in the new grouping""New task"" and again, you will very easily type a subject.The possibility to define the start date for this task , let say on Wednesday and you know you say that it's 2 in 2 days. I have a due date?27th Friday, so this star dates should begin on Wednesday andbe complete on Friday.I can have a reminder search again, change the ring-tone I want, and I will be reminded.At 8:30 on Friday that there is a task pending, that today is not started because it's not created yet you can change the priority into ""High"" and we see that here the completeness of the task is zero again  hasn't been createdThe owner it's myself, so this task is assigned to me. If you  ""save and close"" you have a task here because I have requested the next 7 days. If I click on today have no task for today. Next 7 days.the task that I have just Just created which is due on the 27th on Friday. If I want to see all my overdue tasks. I select ""overview"" Here.  If I have an assigned task which we will see in a few minutes, etc etc. So you can easily see your task.Open the task that is in progress defined the completeness of the progress , ""Save & close"" and continue to have for example, the new task.If you need to create a task and assign it to someone very easy also : again the famous right click. ""New task"" here ""or in the Ribbon Button), if you click with a new task and if you want toasign it to someone ; subject could be ""Get the report completed""With the start date onWednesday, due date :  next week on the 31st, reminder : 9 o'clock on the Saturday,  due date:  It is not started and there here, you've got in the ribbon.a button tasks, which you will be able to assign someone.Don't forget to select again, the relevant address list if you haveseveral address listThe account,And if you sent it , this task we will sent to Laurent that will receive the mail today but there is a taskOtherwise, you can again to save it to send it later if everything is notscheduled yetHere you can ask for an updated copy of this task on your task  list ? because maybe you want  the task to be assigned to someone else someone else's . You want to keep an updated copy of the task that you are signing and you can even ask for a status report when it startsWhen the owner mark it as completed.And you see that they are different stages, not started, in progress, completed,  waiting on someone else or deferred.So,If I save it,and if I close.I will get in my mail, an information when the task is completed and again you see the possibility to filter your task to see all the task that you have to perform.Well,That's how to create appointments MeetingsAnd I hope this has been helpful.and don't forgetto take advantage, make the best use of this, Thank you.",2016,N/A,[],[],[],1660.0,webcast
897,en,Outlook 2016 - share and collaborate quickly,217.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training.2During this training, we will discover and discuss how to share and collaborate quickly with Outlook.3Welcome to this training.4My name is Charles Bonachera5and we are going to spend the next 45 minutes together.6The plan of this session:7We will discover how to view and use several calendars from Outlook,8your calendar and several others if you decide to see and use them.9We will also see and discover how to share your own calendar10easily, internally or externally.11By internally, I mean inside the organization.12By externally, I mean with anybody.13Of course, there are big differences between both kinds of sharing.14Then we'll see how you can delegate your calendar to someone.15For that, we will see how you can manage the access permissions to your calendar.16That's the objective: discover mainly these features which are in Outlook and in the calendar part of Outlook.17Let's start from the beginning.18For that, let's go to Outlook.19From your web mail, you all know how to access your web mail,20Here, I have access to Outlook and to go to the calendar21and to share and delegate your calendar,22you can easily go to the calendar.23At the left-bottom part of your screen,24there are several icons25that you can select26to go in the functions of Outlook.27Here for example, to the calendar.28In the Folder pane of the calendar,29you will find your calendar or calendars.30Here, as I have, you have different accounts configured in Outlook31because each time you configure a new Webmail, a new account in Outlook,32the corresponding calendar will appear in this list.33I have 4 accounts.34It means that normally, in the list, all the calendars appear35and I just have to check one box regarding my account36to see the calendar of this account,37to display the account38and check if I don't need this account.39In the View pane,40I can deselect or close a calendar.41In my calendars, we will first see how you can easily add new calendars.42For that, in the Folder pane,43select ""My Calendars"" in this group of calendars44""My Calendars"".45If you right-click,46you get a function, an option to add calendars47and you will be able, very easily, to add from your calendar.48Be careful in case you have several accounts,49several mailboxes configured in Outlook,50to select the one that is relevant in terms of person,51to select the address list of the organization where the person that you are looking for is,52the right organization.53In the field, you just need to enter the name of the person54that you are looking for.55I found it.56I click on the calendar to add it to my list.57I can see that in my list of calendars, Philippe Houyau has been added58and on the right part of my reading pane59I have now the calendar of my colleague.60By default, I can see his availability61in a few words:62Free, Tentative and Busy.63In case the time period is busy, it means that he is not available.64So it's very easy.65Each time you right-click on My Calendars, you can add a new calendar from any address book66and if you have many accounts,67you just have to select the correct one68and the system will give you access to the person69whose calendar will be added to your list.70In terms of view of these calendars,71we can see that my calendar on the left is in one color.72The other one is in another color73and they are side by side.74There is an option to overlay75if you right-click on any calendar and select ""Overlay"",76they will be overlaid.77Here I have the calendars together.78The different colors will show me the availability of both my colleagues and I79so that I can, for example, select the proper time for a meeting.80here for example, on Thursday from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, I could have a meeting with my colleague81or from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock.82Also I could schedule a meeting with my colleague.83When you are finished, there is an arrow in the tab of my colleague84where you can decide to view side-by-side85to go back to the side-by-side view of the calendar.86So you can easily add a calendar from any person of your organization87or at least from the global address list of the different organizations88on the different accounts that you may have in Outlook.89So that's the way to easily add new calendars.90You have a large list of calendars91and by checking them you can easily add new calendars.92You can overlay them to have them together93and, with the colors, see which time is available for a meeting.94The new option is to add calendars from your colleagues in your own calendar.95That's a way to add calendars from people in your organization.96Now we will discuss and see the way to share your calendar with someone inside or outside your organization.97For that, select your calendar, right-click,98and at the bottom of the menu, you find ""Share"".99Don't forget the right-click which gives you access to a lot of actions wherever you are in Office 365.100It's very helpful.101In Share, you have 2 possibilities.102We will first discover the first one, which is ""Share Calendar""103the normal sharing, I would say,104which is a real sharing which in fact is an email105that you can send to someone inside your organization.106Be careful to select the right one.107Here, for example.108In this email with a predefined subject,109""Sharing invitation Trainer"",110you will send the possibility to the recipient here,111one of my colleagues,112to see the details of your calendar.113Here for example, by default my colleague will only see my availability:114available, tentative or busy.115if I select ""Limited details"",116my colleague will be able to see some more details added to the information, the availability.117And ""Full details"" will display all the information displayed in my calendar118in terms of availability, place119in terms of content of the meeting or appointment, etc.120In the same email,121you may request the recipient to also share his or her calendar with you.122Check ""Request permission to view recipient's calendar""123for that and in this case, they will give you permission to see also their calendar.124There is also a mail, so you may leave a message to your colleague.125And if you send the email,126you will give full details access to your calendar to your colleague in this case.127This way, they will be able to see all the complete details of your whole calendar.128That's the way to share your calendar internally, inside your own organization.129I don't save130and I will show you how to do the same with someone external to your organization.131A person which is external to your organization, by definition, will not get access to your mailbox nor to your calendar132because there is no relationship between another person and your organization if the permissions are not given and by default they are not.133So what you can do to share your calendar134is a kind of sharing which is not the same category.135If you right-click and select Share,136 you get ""E-mail Calendar""137and in this case there is another pop-up like what happened before.138Now there is a pop-up where you will decide which calendar among the one(s) in your own calendar139which one(s) you want to share.140You will select a date range:141will you share today only?142just tomorrow?143the next 7 days?144the next 30 days?145the whole calendar?146(meaning from now until the end of your of time)147Or specified dates, for example from the 23rd, today, to the 23rd of February.148Then, you also need to decide which kind of details you are going to share with this external person:149Availability only (free, busy or tentative,150working elsewhere or out of office).151That's related to your calendar.152Limited details (availability and subjects of calendar items only).153Or Full details (availability and full details of calendar items),154everything which is in your calendar will be also showed and seen by the external person155that will receive this email because it's an email.156If you select Advanced, you can also include in your calendar private marked items.157In this case the recipients will be able to see the full details of your calendar.158You decide when you want to share: daily schedule or a list of events.159Let's have ""Daily schedule""160because it's visually more interesting.161I click on OK.162Instead of giving access your calendar, which is not possible because the recipient is external to your organization,163in this email, the content of your email appears164which is directly copied in  the body of the email itself,165so it's kind of a screenshot of your calendar,166that you can now send to anybody outside your organization.167It's not a way to share your calendar since it's not possible with someone external168but a way to nevertheless send your calendar169for example, to decide with this recipient together for a time range for a meeting or an appointment.170Send the email171and the recipient will get an exact view of when you are available or not.172That is the way to share your calendar with someone externally173which is quite helpful in certain cases to decide on a time range for a meeting.174Here we have seen and discussed the way to share calendars.175Now we will see how you can delegate you calendar to someone.176We will start inside your organization.177For this, you have to be in the calendar part of Outlook178and from your calendar, in the ribbon,179in the Home tab,180you have Calendar Permissions.181By clicking on the Calendar Permissions,182you will get access to the full details of the permissions regarding the calendar.183You can see that, by default, the selection is put on ""Permission Level: Free/Busy time""184meaning that anybody in your organization can see that you are free or busy.185That's by default.186Anybody in your organization can see if you are free or busy187but you can change this permission for all users in your organization,188which is not recommended.189You can give free/busy time.190What you can do, it's a possibility which may be very helpful for a group of people191or if you want someone to be able to take your own mailbox and manage it192you can find an email address and add someone193and give more permissions than the default ones.194Here for example, your colleague will see the free/busy times, but also the subject and the location of your meetings.195That's in terms of reading.196If you want your colleague to be able to write something in your calendar,197you may decide what they will be able to write.198For example, to create items,199to create subfolders,200to edit own201and edit all.202Edit own to edit their own added items.203Edit all so they will be able to edit anything that is in your calendar.204So be very careful with that.205If you select ""Full details"" in ""Read"",206they will see full details.207Write: they will be able in this case, for example, to create subfolders but not items.208In this subfolder, it is the same for the delete section: by default there is no possibility to delete an item,209but you can decide to give them the possibility to delete their own items210or all items if you prefer.211By clicking on OK, it gives this person the possibility to manage your own calendar with different permissions212with other permissions than those which are by default given by the system.213which is to see only the free/busy time.",2016,Beginner,[],[],[],1273.0,webcast
899,en,Excel 2016 - Quickly enhance your results,22.0,"Hello and welcome to this Office 365 MOOC training.2The topic of this session will be to see how to quickly enhance your results in an Excel worksheet.3Welcome to this session my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together.4The plan: What are we going to see during this little time range?5We will see the concept of tables and specifically the automatic formatting.6Then we will see the conditional formatting and how it can help to enhance your tables.7Then we will see how to insert and customize sparklines,8which is something new in Office 2016.9Finally, we will see how to create and customize charts.10Let's go to Excel.11I created a table.12And let's see how we can customize this table.13First, we are in the table and you have to be in the table before formatting.14In the upper part of the screen, you know that now for sure,15what is called the ribbon,16which changes depending on where you are and which tab you select in the list of tabs.17Here in the home tab,18with the ribbon corresponding to the home tab,19we can find here ""Format as Table"".20Here appears different types of tables21for the format.22You can select any of these depending on your what you prefer.23Perhaps the the type of the table itself.24For example, I can select in the medium part of it this format.25The system requests where the data are26in your worksheet.27So you can change it.28This is your table.29The system has normally detected the table on its own.30Indicate if your table has headers, which is the case.31It has 3 headers:32Category, January 16 and January 17.33If we click on OK, the table is formatted directly with the color that we have decided to apply to this table.34If you go back to Home35and ""Format as Table"",36you can change design.37Just by hovering over a color or a type of table,38you have a preview of what would be the result of your different choices.39That's the first possibility to format your table.40There is another one that you can get to in Page Layout.41You have selected your table. On the left part of the ribbon, of the Page Layout tab,42you find different themes.43And again your table is adapted44not only in terms of color, but also in terms of font45and size.46So that's another way to apply a new theme to your table.47Let me just see that very quickly.48So you can decide which theme you prefer to apply to your table.49Then in terms of calculation and table.50Excel is very quick to calculate and analyze data.51Here we have a set of analyses and data.52We are going to see a few things that we can do with the table.53First, you probably know that you can have totals for a column.54If you go to Home, at the far right,55we have an ""AutoSum"" button56that will automatically select the cell in the table.57From the drop-down list, we will be able to decide what the content of this cell will be.58Is it just a sum?59Or it can be the average of this column.60Or it can be the maximum or the minimum value of these data.61Let's try the sum.62On the next cell, the table has been configured with the Format as Table button.63We have select the theme so this last row has been dedicated to the total.64It means that as soon as I have selected my AutoSum,65I can select the drop-down list with what I prefer to have.66On the left, I have the sum of all the figures in the G column.67Here, I have the average number of the H column.68Of course, I change it.69Again, here I have the sum.70What you can also have from here in this table,71in terms of formatting,72is that you can just by clicking anywhere in the table,73if you then go to Data,74you will be able, first, to ask for a filter.75You see that a few arrows, drop-down lists, have been added to each header of my columns.76If I click on the header, I can deselect everything and just see these figures.77These will be for food and I can have my January 16 purchase.78And here, the January 17 purchase.79You can see that the icon has changed, showing that a filter has been applied to this column.80If I click, I see that food has been selected81If I reselect all, I get back all elements.82So that the first possibility to apply filters.83I can have a list of each row being a different value.84It's not very interesting.85But if you have same values and the same columns, in this case you will get all the results of the same value for this column.86So that's the first thing. Another thing that you can do in your table87is to apply a sort.88If you click in the table,89you will be able to decide on which column you can sort.90Here for example, I can say that I want to sort by category.91What would I prefer to sort on:92of course, values.93And I choose, as these are alphabetical values,94I can decide to have A to Z or Z to A95or perhaps even have a custom list.96If I decide to have A to Z97and apply my choice,98my table is ordered in terms of category A, B, etc.99That's the first possibility.100If you click again on Sort, you can choose January 16,101values again, to sort on values,102and here I have Smallest to Largest which I can change to Largest to Smallest.103This time, the whole table will be sorted on January 16 column.104You can see that this is the largest field value, and at the bottom is the smallest value.105You can do it for the last one.106And now you can remove these totals.107These were the first possibilities of formatting.108If I go back to Home,109I can get just beside the Format as Table110something called ""Conditional Formatting"".111Here I have a list of possibilities.112The first one is Highlight Cells Rules.113For example, Greater Than.114If I select this and first I select my table.115Highlight Cells Rules, Greater Than.116I want to see everything that is over 500117in light red.",2016,N/A,[],[],[],706.0,webcast
900,en,Get Started Excel 2016 - Easily Create Data Synthesis,33.0,"Hello and welcome to this short training session on Office MOOC training.This session is from the Get Started with Office training catalogand this particular session is entitled “Excel 2016: Easily Create Data Syntheses”.My name is Steven Ryan and I will be your trainer for this short session.In this session we will look at pivot tables in Excel 2016and the goal of the session is to help you understand how to use Excel pivot tables to analyze and synthesize your data.Let's first briefly discuss what Excel is used for.Although Excel has been around since 1985,its key essential use and purpose hasn't changed much over the years.It is still essentially used for 2 purposes:for calculations and formulas for things like invoicing and accounting and so on,and for the analysis of tables, data analysis and synthesis.This particular training session deals with the second of those Excel uses: data analysis.By being able to analyze all the data in your worksheetit can help you to make better business decisions.Sometimes it's hard to know where to start especially when you've got lots of data.Excel can help you by recommending and then automatically creating pivot tables,which are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore and present your data.There are different kinds of tables in Excel: value tables, calculation tables, invoices...You also get data tables which are always composed of these elements:titles, column headers and value lines.You can see a data table on this slide, which is basically a table with columns and values in it.Let's have a quick demo at some of the quick analysis options in Excel 2016and also to copy some data from a sheet and paste it into a blank sheet and then format it as a tableto get us started so we can move on to look at the data synthesis in the next section.Kick off briefly looking at the flash fill option which can help you to fill in tables of data sometimes.This one is part of the sort of the take a tour welcome to Excel worksheetyou get as part of the templates in Excel 2016.We have to do those start to fill out the table in the right, in the instructions,in the First Name column, we type the first name Nancy,press Enter,then starts typing the next name and you'll seeit picks up straight away, press enter and it will flash fill in the rest of those for you,showing that the value following is the first part of the name in the email address in the first column.It can be very useful for filling in the data that's got a common sequence or theme to it.Let's look at the analysis wizard in here as well.This is a very brief demo part of the take a tour that shows you how to use the quick analysis sheet.All we have to do as stated in the instructions is select the table on the right.I can click and drag the whole tableand when I release the mouse button a little graphic pops up,a little option called ""Quick Analysis"".If I click on that it gives us options for formatting.For example, on this one I have how I want that to be viewed.If I hover over each, you'll see that it updatesto show me what that sort of formatting style looks like.Here I have concepts that shows up and down in values,greater than values, text-based things, we can clear formatting, assign colors and data bars to it...There are also things for charts.You can click on charts and it will show you the sorts of charts you can create out of that data,different styles, scattered charts, bar charts and so on.There's plenty more as well besides.It gives you some options for different types of totaling, like sum and averageand as you hover over it, it actually updatesor the preview of that in the table without actually changing anything. It's a preview of that information.You can add sparklines as wellto your data to show you the movements of data.The most interested one is the Tables option.Let's click on Tables.I get options on the table or pivot tables.It shows us recommended pivot tables available for our dataand how it would be represented.you get a preview of that as you hover over.This one is the sum of the Q1 sales for example,sum of Q2 and the account of the companies listed in that particular table.You can also click on Morewhich shows you other recommended tables, which is the same thing we've already seen,or you can start with a blank pivot table which opens up in a separate sheet.If I click on that, it opens on a separate sheetand allows us to create our own pivot table.I'm going to switch back to that original chart.Now we're going to copy this data,let's copy that across and do this in a different way to show how you can do it manually.We can copyand create a new worksheet,select a celland choose Paste to paste the values themselvesand not bring across any formats or anything, just the values.Then we can resize to make it fit.We can then select part of that dataand we can choose Format as Table.Then we can choose different formatting options for our data, let's choose that one for example.Let's say what's the data source.I select all of it basically. Has it got headers in the table? It has so I select the option and click OK.That gives some formatting to our table.You can choose the style options to change the table style to something else.I'm going to show you how to quickly create pivot tables from that data.I'll switch back to the slides for a moment.You'll see in a moment in the demo how to create a pivot tableand get different areas in the pivot tablein the main area which is on the right side.This one is actually in French, but I'll show you the English one in a moment.There's a section at the top and this is basically fields table title,the pivot table fields area.Then there are 4 other areas on that tabthat lets us do things to assemble an analyze data.That's the filters columns, rows and values areas that we're going to usein the demo coming up shortly to show how they are used.To do that we have to select a cell,any cell in that table,and in the insert tabwe have a pivot tables or recommended pivot tables.If I select ""Recommended Pivot Tables""it gives us the same screen as earlier with the recommended tables we can pick from the listor we can click on ""Blank Pivot Table"".That is essentially the same as if I click on Pivot Table here.It then asks us where we want to create it, what's the range,do we want to use the range that we've selected or use an external data source,do we want to put the pivot table somewhere on this existing worksheet or a new worksheet.I'm going to choose the whole range I've selected and place it on a new worksheet.Click on OK and it will open up a separate sheet.That is Sheet3.We can see this area.Here's where we going to  build our pivot table report on the leftand on the right we can see our pivot table fields section at the topand we can see these other areas below for the assembly filters: columns, rows and values.You've got options to choose fields to add to target.We can either drag or select them.For example, if I select ""Industry""it adds itself to the rows column over there, Rows area.We can also drag and drop.I could grab Q1 sales, drop it into valuesand you see it starts to build up our table.I could do the same for Q2 sales.You could also modify the actual values.If I select the sum of Q1 salesand choose ""Value Field Settings""I got options for how I summarize that data,the type of calculation used to summarize the data.If I change that to Max for example, it now says ""Max of Q1 sales""and the column header also has been changed to say that as well.I'll switch that back to the sum value for the moment.A couple of things to notice here: if I switch back to the original source data sheetand have a look at ""Industry""we've got several industries which are repeated or not.We've got tech, travel, utility (that's 3),beverage (4), medical (5), miscellaneous (6)and then education (7) and financial (8).There's 8 different industries listed there.If I switch back to our sheet,we see 8 industries.That's good information, we know that's right.If you want to add a new row for example,we're going to add a new companyand perhaps we are going to use a new industry:Mandarine BS trainingand we can set some values in there.If we switch back to our pivot tablewe have to refresh that informationand right click anywhere, click on ""Refresh""and you see that the right labels have been added for training and the sum of the sales for Q1 and Q2.We could also add a new column of sales valuesso I'll switch back to our original data source sheet.Let's say we have got a Q3 salesand then populate that with some values.We'll copy some of these values downand then put a different value in for the lastvalue here.Similarly, if we switch back to our pivot table,right-click and click on Refreshand now we've got Q3 sales and I can select thatand it will be added to our values here.I could have dragged it rather than check the box, that's the same thing.Now we've got values for the sum of Q3 sales as well.If we update our data source sheet with different informationand refresh ityou see that those values are updated.Another thing we could also do on is use the company value/fielddrag it to the Filters columnand we will get a filter at the top of the screen.I could then filter different information on different companies.I want to look at Mandarine only so I select that one to see that information.You can also check the ""Select Multiple Items"" checkbox and select multiple values,click on OK and we'll see multiple values that way.Then go back to select all,choose OK and we're back to original values.This provides a really simple way of representing your data,presenting your data a different way or looking at it from different perspectives,different values and assigning different filters, different field settings,different calculations to base our summary information on as well.To summarize:pivot tables are way of analyzing and providing automatic syntheses of your data,including if you've got really large amounts of data, it can be very useful and it's automatic.You can also customize everything:you can customize the formulas, formatting, order, sorting and so on.Remember to right click the mouse and choose refresh after you modify your source data.Data syntheses with Pivot tables in Excel is really easy to use, there's really no need to be an expert in data since you can work and get some real value from it.That concludes this short session.Thank you attention and we hope that you can make the best use of this training going forward.",2016,Beginner,[],[],[],783.0,webcast
901,en,Word 2016 - Introduction to word processing,153.0,"Welcome to the surface 365 training. The session, which is about to start is related to a big topic, which is called get started with a face and the subject of the session is just to have an introduction to work processing and I work processing we?Introduction to the Microsoft Word which is in the Office 365 switch the word processing software application welcome. So to the session. My name shall Bernard Shaw and we're going to spend the next 3245 minutes.What will be discussing during this time here is the plan we will first discovered interface quick discovery of the interface with it at the layout? How is it distributed in the screen then we will see how to create and format text? Which is?Um of uhm well, then we will see that we can apply styles starts, which are provided by the application to work quicker and more efficiently. We will see how to make changes to the.And all the changes that we have that we may may have an form that can also track and at the end, we see how to save the document. The different possibilities that we have to save documents on our locally in our computer or using the functionality's office.T 5 online that is on the cloud in the cloud to save documents and possibly to share them if needed. The goal of this session clearly to discover Microsoft Word and quickly create documents on arrow.So let's start by using?Word, which isHere.And the first time you open word you will arrive on the home page on the left and see a list of documents the least just called recent so this week last week and all the documents of course, very, very first time that you.Open this page. This list with the course and will be populated each time you open a new document or you created new document on the left part of the screen. As you can imagine just by having a look at it. Lots of templates are provided to you.Each's name that suggests his function for example, that you're a creative resume design by some design format creative cover letter for each coverage are block post just you.A question of blog, etc, etc. But for the purpose of this session, which is to discover the 2. We will start with the blank document blank page. And for that very first template even empty template to blank document that I will select and I selected it. Of course, but you get you.Is of course the blank page blank document that would be exactly the case? When we start to write in a notebook are open on a piece of paper blank page. And now it would be up to us to write down and here to create.Use of all the functions of Microsoft Word just a quick words on the interface again asking the rest of the office, which we can hear find the text.Uh each top related to a topic UM in search designs. Of course, the design of the page. The layout other page. References would be to get the references inside the page etc. If we want to perform mailings to have review of.In terms of spelling and grammar for example, to check the spelling and grammar if we want to work to count the word. Exeter out interview. It's everything that is at our view, which is visual and that we can change directly from this step for each.Underneath we found what's called the ribbon and that you may probably knew from other office applications. Each time you change the tab the the ribbon adapts to the new tab? Of course, providing you the most common and the?Just usual commands that are related to one tab and you are supposed to be looking for when you select the tab. So here in the home page. The main goal of word.Treatment of course in the homepage. We've got everything that will help us create a document what we need to know with word is that of course, you can write text. I laugh.Prepared.Something, which is supposed to be an introduction to work assessing for example, yeah, um so here you can write anything and just.Start writing things.In theInside the document.So here for example, this is.And.Introductions.OK, So what you can see if it's bad for the system.Underlies, What's supposed to be wrongly spelled you can change. Of course, you can see also here that um the text is in certain formats. But you can write it here font. There is this grouping. This elected to the fonts and here we know which.And you see that there are lots to your disposal and the size here. Other functions so you can also increase and you see that just by selecting or or hovering over the the the figures values you can see the result on screen.So if you want to change the font size very easily the same for the thought it's tough.So here is a Gency FB, Adjarian Outback Ling, etc. So there is no need to select and change each time so losing time again to go faster to what is needed you can just by hovering over the name of?You see instantly see the resource that's the first thing regarding the context. But by defaults. This will propose you calibrate here for example, and you change the the size if needed again to keep here in front of you that you can.On many other things, if you want to have it in both you just select code too. If you if you want to reverse it to normal just click again here is it leak and line etc.And again reverse the color of the font can be changed and see either on the word which you selected or you just select the whole trace of the whole line and you can change it again here and you see again the result.We produced so that you can cite even the background can be changed. If you need it and of course, even here, there is a well art that is, and you can adapt to your document that's the.But there is an important concept in terms of we got word is that?Hey, beautiful, I have right?Something there is a concept that is important to to know I understand is that the notion of paragraph uhm.If youJust right of course words text kilometric format that is to say without thinking and just entering onscreen the text.The system considers that it is the same paragraph.To show the system that you are changing the paragraph you have to press on the keyboard the?Cheat the enter key.And now you see that the system as.Gone to the beginning of the next line and there now you can start again and you.Paragraph and now the system will consider.All that is written here, I'm just of course, is a metric ass paragraph this one.OK, so.That is interesting and important to know that if you click just in the middle of the paragraph because again this is considered by word as an entire paragraph. You will have the possibility just in the home tab here in the paragraph grouping to format and.Adopt theParagraph itself.For example, he will see that Vardy fault. If we have a look at the paragraph group. We see that here. This is marked checked. It means that the alignment is left and if you leave your cursor if you hover over this part, you see that gives you.Uh align you content with the left margin. That means that if you want to change the alignment to center, you just need to.Put the cursor of the mouse in the middle of the paragraph anywhere. And just by clicking here now center. The whole paragraph is centered and you can see that here.I mean, just copy this.Here this one is unaffected by my previous to ship this you should so this is a paragraph. This is another one, and that's very important when you start writing a text here because the system each time you press the key the enter key on a keyboard.Then the next text to be a new paragraph and it will be formatted totally differently. If we know so that you can format or different paragraph independency, so of course again, you see this paragraph has been scented, UM this one.Can youTo copy text this one, so it's not the point that that shows that it is a new paragraph. It's really. When you enter press the enter key on the keyboard.I can now if I select this D lineman is this type right you see that this near aligned. This is Judy centered and I kept to the same with another.Paragraph and it could be also different uhm.OK so if I click third paragraph, I can have it at it, said here is justify, meaning that both left and right text is exactly adjusted to the to my page weather.Alright Here it is not OK will see that here there is an indentation act so that's the very first possibility that you have with the new paragraphs is the possibility to decide about the alignment justification is it justified centered is just.Not that first thing then again, there is known each at my supposed to select the whole paragraph just by keeping the mouse cursor in the middle of it, you see that here you can also modify the line.Paradise spacing so if you click you see that you have here 1115. One 2:30 contacts to see if the line spacing between the line. Of course, spacing between lines so you can add space before paragraph. Remove space after paragraph and if you want to.Just to keep we see that document is.Justify all right, and we can decide about the indentation so we can hear the indentation. You see that the the whole paragraph is distributed to the right part of the screen, OK remember control pressure control, she ends.Key at the same time to reverse who get back by the words just over there in the very, very belper left corner of the screen. You get undo typing here or of course. We do the last command here lines X and it was OK.Paint the spacing you can change.The the the space between the lines of your paragraphs very important, um of course, you see in this paragraph here. But other possibilities. If you want to see each time there.Sing a grouping of commands here this little haro, you can click and again to the full options of the paragraph formatting with sometimes even examples here, OK, you can see what would be the result of our choice.Terms of indentation spacing general alignment for example, or outline level line and page breaks. If we need also which is something different that we not discuss here, but again so.Are the different possibilities of formatting your paragraph in terms of?Paragraph you see that here is a command, which will increase or decrease index. If you preach here, you see that the whole paragraph will be indented.Uh so.That's a possibility to indent each time you press indentation is one way further to the right. Of course, you can go back and wait further chooser left that's another possibility so remember each time.You press the enter key you change paragraph something that you can do. Also, if you can create lists an example if you enter fire up witcher?Yeah.Is the least so you can first go to the spacing to change the spacing?English or at space or OK. That's the minimum, but now you can also with this little.Sure glitch library select bullets in France at the first possibility if you select.This if you just enter you see that all the least will.Take the same tool, it's something also here if you select complete you can have to see but just list with number alignment left here number alignment left also but differently spelled you can think of this.Um the alignment based on the on letters.So different etc. So of course, if you select this one issue and to fix. It will take the number threes number 5. Sorry that's why they just released also possible here library list in this case.Sorry. The Library of Mr. Now this time, if I enter you see that by default. GPU Indent, one uhm one further to the right the bullets in front is changing OK.Little but you can also.Can alsoSelect sure and request for?These and in this case if after fire we decide to Indent. Once that we did. One dot one for example, a chapter a paragraph first paragraph within.Um set paragraph and you see third level folks level etc. So each time can bring you controls. It reverts different possibilities. You see here. You can do the same with good. It's always so you can have.Used creative andSame for chapters you see.Chapter in disturb you but the truth 123 and 4 based on these templates that you have here OK uhm.So very interesting, too, great performer a kind of hierarchy OK with this.Least library that you can select to mix to meet Unix or so in paragraph. You can you see that you can just buy again now leaving the cursor in the paragraph you can change?The content and you don't need to select it just hovering over you can change and see the changing.Zip ground oh uh what you can also do is you can change the complete style of the program here. We were very few things in fact, but if you look at the ribbon just over Matthew page. You'll see that there are.Our group, which is called stars and by default, you see that the normals Titans applied to do the whole text. In fact now. If you want to change it if you again, let hover over the each style you can see.Can.You can change this time, um be careful for heading in heading 2. These are a body changes. Of course, but it's based for for example, if you want them to have a table of contents by selecting heading one. This would be considered then set up contacts.Jected unset chapter, she would be a title of a page so for example, if we insert a page break whoever another page if I.Uh.Now you can have.Spice Gonna die, too, and you see that it is considered night title.The subtitle brings on K so you can completely adapt.Uh so for each page. You have a statue was the title. So you pretty. She just use styes and again, you don't need to select everything if you select your?A paragraph use instantly was becoming a what would become new paragraph if you change the style of your?A bit of also, if you could hear again as not just we did in the paragraph styles. You can get the whole anyway went together, so she works a whole lot of.Change.Styes available.Sick rather preview you can see here after lots all those dives that you can modify here in your.You're a document other things that you can do in your document you can so that posts for matching the stars, which in the hierarchy. If you you of course, can do different things. If we go to the.Again, we see that you can change.The whole.Document and then when you have the title, the title will be changed here also.So you can change the whole.Again, the the titles will be that way.

902,en,Word 2016 - Discover DTP with word,25.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 training.2This session is included in the big topic called: ""Get Started with Office"".3This session's subject will be the discovery of desktop publishing with Word.4We are going to use Microsoft Word5and in particular the desktop publishing capacities of Word6which are quite interesting when you try to create some commercial documents for instance.7Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we are going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together.8What will we be discussing during this time range?9We will see how to work with pictures in Microsoft Word,10how we can insert pictures.11Then we will see how to insert shapes and text boxes,12which is quite interesting because you don't have to design on your own the shapes and text boxes.13Some are automatically inserted when we decide it.14Then we will see how to insert automatic charts and graphics.15At the end, we will see how to export and share documents16so that clients, customers or colleagues can take these documents into account in their own actions and tasks.17The goal of this session is to discover Microsoft Word Desktop publishing features18which are very interesting and powerful.19So let's start from the beginning, for that let's go to Word.20It will open in a second, here it is coming.21Very first thing you have on Word,22you have on the left a list of the most recent documents23that have been open with Word.24Of course it will be empty but as soon as you start working with Word, the list will be populated with new documents.25On the right, there are templates that you can use to avoid losing time when creating some documents.26They are already created for you.27At least, you have to then adapt and update the content.28For the the purpose of this session29I'm going to open a blank document.30A blank document.31When you need to write a document, a letter, anything, you have to start writing.32Here we are taking into account the desktop publishing capacities of Word.33For that, I'm going to show you lots of tricks and functions that are available directly on Microsoft Word.34One word on the interface:35The old menus are now composed of tabs.36Each tab gives access to a lot of actions and commands37related to its subject.38For example, Insert and insertion.39We will soon be using that because that's mainly the core of this session.40All actions and commands related to insertions of documents or whatever41are available in the ribbon.42If I change to design, I get other commands.43So let's have a look from the beginning.44Here is the first thing that you can do for example.45Let me start a document.46You're going to have the title of the document.47We can increase the size.48When you are in the Home tab, you can see that styles are available.49With styles, you can change the style applied to your document50and to your text.51Here, for example, it is ""Intense Emphasis"".52Wherever you are in the text, if you want to emphasize something,53you can select in the styles,54in the options ""Intense Emphasis"" for example.55Otherwise, for example, just ""Title"".56I will show you what you can do with text.57If we go to the Insert tab,58which we will soon be exploring more,59at the far right,60you find something called, in the text command group, ""Drop Cap"".61For example, you can instantly increase the size of the first letter,62here is an example,63as you may find in a document,64some kind of documents, in some books, for example,65but not not only.66You can even decide which fonts you will use.67If you select for example, Algerian,68you can also change the lines to drop.69Here you have a first example of the desktop publishing possibilities.70I will enter a text with a capital letter.71That's my text.72The first interesting thing in terms of publishing in Word73is for example,74in the pictures.75You can insert pictures in your document.76If I go there, for example,77and insert this picture,78my picture will instantly be inside the document.79But not only.80You can insert the picture wherever you are,81and you can then move it to where you want to move it.82But if we look at the newly open Picture Tools tab,83Format Picture Tools,84you can see that you have the possibility to correct your picture.85For example, here,86sharpening the picture.87If you go back, you can also change the brightness and contrast of the color.88Each time you hover over this, you can see the result in your own picture.89That's the first possibility.90If you go to the next function available,91you can change the color saturation,92the color tone...93Well, have an action on the colors of your picture.94For example, here I can over-saturate it in terms of color,95to have a more shocking blue, a strong blue, and even an orange sand.96That's another possibility.97If we continue with this, you can even apply artistic effects to your picture.98Like this.99So that's like a painting.100If we look at the Picture Styles,101you can even change the style of the picture itself.102For example, you can change the position of the picture,103you can apply edges.104If you want to have something more precise,105you can right-click,106Format Picture,107you have on the right the possibility to access all the functions and for example, change the transparency.108Or even change the artistic effects.109So there are many possibilities in terms of actions on pictures.110When you select the picture, in terms of layout options,111you can decide how the text will be wrapped around the picture.112Here it is in line with text, but you can also text wrap and change it.113The way the system will interact with the picture, it will interact with your text by moving it.114The way the text will be wrapped around the picture.115If you look at the rest of the ribbon116you can see that you can compress the picture, change the picture, reset the picture,117change the border.118In terms of borders, you can change the borders.119There are many available functions to start working in terms of publishing on your document.120It is possible to insert pictures, but not only.121If we go to Insert,122We can see that we can insert online pictures,123in this case you will have access to Bing, for example,124to ask for more pictures.125In this case, you will be able to enter other pictures126from the web this time127and in this case you will be able to apply effects128to what you have or change the layout129and resize the picture,130which is one of the most interesting possibilities.131If we go back to Insert,132we have seen online pictures,133you can also insert shapes.134If you insert a shape, you can write on it.135If you click on the shape,136you see that there's a Format tab137in the Drawing Tools that can allow you to you change instantly the color of the shape,138apply a WordArt,139style, to the letters inside.140And you have a lot of possibilities available.141You can also increase or decrease the size of the text.142There are a lot of possibilities in terms of shape.143If you go to the shapes, there are a lot of shapes that you can use:144arrows, if you want to show something.145You just have to change anything146and you can have text inside.147So there are also many possibilities in terms of shapes, but not only.148I will continue to show you other publishing possibilities.149If we go to the Insert tab,150you can insert shapes and icons151but you cannot insert SmartArt.152This is very interesting if, for example, you have to describe a process in a commercial document.153For example, I inserted SmartArts and I will have my process described in a few seconds.154There are 2 tabs this time: Design and Format.155In the Format tab, I can change the format.156Here the style is polished.157With Insert, etc., I can change158and apply the style that I prefer.159We can change the way the picture interacts with the text.160You can also instantly try other layouts161for the same purpose.162So you can even change your mind and select another SmartArt or continue exploring different styles.163You can even change the color to have something more corresponding to your needs:164the color of your logo or whatever.165If you have a chart inside your company, for example.166SmartArt: if I continue exploring, because it's very interesting,167first you can also have screenshots.168You can,169if you select ""Screenshot"", you see that you have all the windows that open to select the one from which you want to have a screenshot170that could be included in your document, here for example.171You can resize it .172You can decide how it will interact with it.173Right here, you can change the way the text will interact.174It's very interesting because in a few seconds we are going to include something which is on another window175and it is a really interesting feature,176for example, something from the Internet.177That thing that I wanted you to see 178the insertion of a chart.179All the charts, for example Excel, are available in the bar.180If you select a bar, a pie, the system will include a pie181and you can change the content, the caption.182For example, since a date.183You can then decide whether you want to have the data labels,184you can change the style of your pie.185So there are many possibilities.186I like this one.187You can even separate with a click.188So there are many possibilities with the insertion of charts,189pretty much as if you were in Microsoft Excel.190You can even filter the data.191So there are very powerful possibilities.192If I stay in Insert,193I can also instantly insert a textbox at the far right.194You can select it195and move it where you want.196Each time you have a new object: Drawing Tools, Format.197You can instantly change the shape styles.198You can change the WordArt applied to its text.199If you right-click on that,200you can even201insert a caption.202Here is my caption and it can be modified in terms of font and size.203Everything is resized instantly.204So with Insert you can do a lot of things,205mainly inserts textboxes,206different styles of textboxes that you then will be able to modify and you can edit points if you want to change the size of the caption.207Text also is available and you can change it to have another kind of stylish layout.208These are part of the possibilities that you can apply to a Word document and is this way209have Word closer to a desktop publishing tool than just to a writing tool.210If we go back, we will see how to export and share.211If you go to File, in Export,212you will be able to create a PDF document.213and in this case click on ""Create PDF"".214You will also have a possibility to share.215You have all these functions available:216""Share with People"", in this case you will have to save to the cloud first, and on OneDrive or SharePoint on the web.217You can share it as usual by email218and sent as attachment, send PDF, etc.219You also have the possibility to present your document online220with a new function of Microsoft that you can discover in another MOOC training.221You can send by instant messaging with Skype from Office 365,222or post it on a blog, well, you have a lot of possibilities, or save it on a drive online or on your PC223if you decide and in this case you can browse your PC to save your document wherever you want.224So different possibilities online or on your computer.225We we have seen a lot of possibilities in terms of publishing.226I hope it has been useful and helpful.227Thank you for attending this session228and I hope that you can make the best

What are they different tools that we get to uh to be able to?Set up reflation to organize these reflection around these organizing project and we set the output change quickly with all the implicated stakeholders, so for that. We had just needed to go to.The wet because most of the solutions are available on the web for that it means that you will have to connect to.Your Office 365 account again on the web once you've done so you drink again. Your credentials and getting the password will be connected to your account online again, you will have at your disposal all the applications.Honey provides to you through again this Office 365 online account.Um.For that US.Several possibilities the first one again, he when you want to to organize a project too big but you still want to use modern communication Ways and share information included.Sing some documents and if you want to really have a follow-up of these documents. There is available on the office 3651 solution which is a new kind of social network enterprise social network, which is called Jenner.If you look at these uhm lot of applications which are available directly from your home page. In Office 365 or 9. You have along other once you've got shared something called again, this is a new entrance.That we let you will soon discover that communicate very easy with all the stakeholders in your project so she afraid sample again. The label on standby but could be any other one the interesting thing is that true can from this.Social network imply people.From inside your company but also from outside your body in in some project or on some project. It may be very, very useful and helpful to be able to impact people at the same time internally and externally so here is the homepage of Jammer.In a few seconds on the left, you got the navigation, pane with all the groups you are. You are subscribed to or you that you are member of both internally. This is the company. This is external groups so outside of with people outside of your company.With us.Here in the iama home page. At least the discovery to see who has already created groups and is already has already an activity in Yammer is here. It's discovered some of different gamma groups.The low.Off and they are the ones that so is again the use that you can have sure in the manage label hosted by our project in the?Left person part, you have share the creation of a new group, so if we click here. You we've got a pop up that shows us 2 possibilities. The creation of an internal group and the creation of external and both sides to collaborate with people inside your company or outside.You have to deliver the name of the group and then here you will be able to add people. Of course, if its internal group will find people and take people big people from out inside your company so will be directed linked to the direct link to young directly. Sorry.Your Company Directory Course and then you will have to decide whether it's a public or private access. Public anyone can Jude conversations and participate in to the conversation or private access only group members can view and post in this conversations.Then decide whether he's the group or not, and then you click on create to create the group or again. External group and in this case you have to add people that maybe from outside your company and then just decide whether which persons will be able to see your conversation and post messages.You're only members from other networks, soaproot, members from other networks, so other yammer groups or only members from this book that you are creating at this exact moment, so once you have created so I will not create another one that takes us to create another.This one for example, an external group what will be the advantages of creating group web. Many the first one, is that you can instantly have new conversations with the whole campus or the whole list of member that means that you can instantly share.Communicate with all the people of course, just posting welcome message for example. Of course, any other information that you may find interesting during the management of the project. So here you will have the possibility to create new conversations and J 2 C.Missions to help with post this one and of course, you can see also.Or other conversations interesting things in terms of communication regarding the situation. The first situation in such can again so create share something with a group you can create your pool that's very interest.In terms of of communication if you need to care for advice from other members members or if you need a 12 jacket decision so that's very, very.Which way to go for example?And then you have, I think this was all 3 answers OK, UM next?My phone.Hello.And you see that you can even each time you can have add another answer for the reason if you if you take this other possibility to have fixed one and 61, etc. You can add people to modify and if you post. This all members of the group, which will see the.Be able to answer.Of course, you will be able to underwrite you see here members, so you can add more people. So here for example, I have persons included members already members as it is an external group, which is private you can see this year, only members will see.Good one Sir, but then you will be able to chain to give a new update a Newport praise someone enter the name of the person that you want to to praise so for example, this one. What are you present for is content constant sorry?Moment.It means that you rank your project over around the project you can really.Uhm I know, but give life to your project through new conversations pause phrase pronouncements. So you have all the possibilities in terms of communications first change in terms of communication on the right part where we?Does he have the possibility of course is such a group she looking for something that she will see something which is called info. And here it should click on it, it will be able to add a cannula. Edit you can add a Lynx or of course information so she is the new information at just copy the link so if.Life is a possibility you have to create a link to something interesting share for example, the peace at least information.Um dedicated to the group and related to the the activity of a group share pins. You can even have documents so they could get select from the fight on yammer, meaning in one of the Yammer groups.Or just adding from your OneDrive when drafting you know the storage space that is given to you via the company by Office 365 and in this case you can explore all your OneDrive 5 because you may have several personal.No.Professional personal once over Tibet also group ones share point once and in this case, one of your fish. The groups you are member of which are storage points in this case you can explore them and who and find a document.Different that you can link so from one who you may drink a document to another one, so that's what's very just so in terms of collaboration. Still, you can if we go there and you have included in the Yammer group, so this is the name of the group again so you.Conversations or conversations that have something called 5. That's again, the storage point, which is given to you. And when we will put 2 documents from your own computer. Of course, instantly all members of the group would be able.To see.So here for example, and you can select the files so you can approve document. What is interesting in this case is that everybody of course has access to people when I need everybody and everybody from the group everybody can.On the document and you as owner of the document.You can identify continue to file and you are, and you can decide whether this document is you want or not. We can see here that I have. I have declared this document being the last one if should mark so I can remove this?Fuck and this document would be the change between the possible for all members to identified and chill. I consider being the owner that the document is finished so you can still relate contents to his file. You know which other flours well. Lots of information in terms of communication jobs.Of course in terms of collaboration because if you needed to file.The system, which truck all the changes and it will be very easy to restore a previous version, so for example, an Excel can't of course. I want to change the document the chart here.Change the chart type I change it to chat dressing things. Also, which is not only related Yammer Group. Let Office 365 storage. You don't need to to say you're so she closed things document you can see the comments with.Let's see um seized meaning that you cannot point you can reverse so we store. A previous version, so that's very interesting in terms of document management so in terms of if you have related project, which is not too heavy don't.Buy lots of activities of management again in terms of document communication collaboration and what so ever. You can use this younger group, which gives you access to a lot of things.In terms of in terms of cleanup project management like this, because you have communication with everybody. But you have pauses will instantly know what people think of your or get about some from all people, you can praise people.Cool behavior that's very interesting and important to our people are oppressed by you are by your management and all the possibilities again of collaboration and and and which is a tablet not at least the possibility to have mixed groups with people from inside.Why don't you are?Off yourCompany so I will push you man hope that's the vote. So we can really wear. Many committees to like conversation should we try to conversation to share a conversation with someone else also meant another group visuals about write a reply of course attached document.Images of collaboration communication with a project again not too big is available in the Yammer group, so that's very, very interesting. The first possibility he's here to to organize groups general.Enterprise social network.Test possibility interesting thing, which is available to Office 365.So instantly again we can share all the documents for complete review from anywhere at anytime. I remind you that each you are connected to the Internet. You only need the things just the connection itself. Then you just have your credentials once connected to Office 365 online you have access to OK.Your calendar and these gamma goods that you can manage from anywhere again and it anytime anywhere from the word in the world and at anytime of course, wherever you want? How to organize their affection around in shoe. We've seen that because you can even ask again. Pull up document shared.Citra how to exchange pretty with those indicated stakeholders because instantly when you use gamma group to deliver conversations in your own mailbox stupid received the conversations so if I open?OK.Sure, I have the conversation in the test extreme group is ready, so all newcomers and notifications in my neighbors and I will even able to answer to this group conversation direct and we see that when you are yeah, been added to test.Speech using a general the second one is was 2 net reflection workshops around training. It means that you have to organize workshops. So the different possibility that you face is to try to manage the organization of this event, even more difficult than statement is our.So external busters and in general partners, therefore, reducing that but we found another solution how to centralized exchanges between the various stakeholders. We have seen that. The Yammer Group was first possibility. I will show you another one, and I want to give an attractive and created dimension presentation or of course, is implying.PowerPoint and I will show you a few things about over so the first possibility was the Yammer Group, which again is not is that it for a not treat project. The others, which you may have to again communicate and share information is the.So what is the working within the Yammer Group, which is mostly self and the enterprise social network here is really something different you can create working group from 2 places 2 locations one on your computer?The the chance to have outlook office 2016 installed on your computer and enough history 2016 to an outlook. Of course, so you can from our group, creative groups. Otherwise, you have also the possibilities to go again in Office 365 online and office 3.I'm sure you also you can create groups and even change groups to to include external guests from from External Company. So when you are in outlook in your mailbox. You have here of course in the home tab you have.In the end of the ribbon you have a new group, which is called groups and share us by pattern code new cook. So the group. The new group Working Group is not to be missed.Miss with the the distribution list keep is not a distribution list as the pop-up says that could provides a place for shared compensations 5 and a group calendar and that's a big difference with the Yammer group immigrants the social network.You can do many things here, the difference is that you have one difference is that you have included in the creation of the group of Google calendar. So if you choose a name for your group once you have decided whether it's public or private group and once.Other members will whether you want to subscribe new members so that they also receive group conversations in their inbox, meaning that they don't need to be connected to the group. They will receive both in their group in mailbox and in their personal inbox also conversations once you have.You will find the groups in your account so in your mailbox at the end of your older folders. There will be a new one code groups where you will find all the groups that you have been added to web first crab.I've been added as members, so she I have already far groups that effective and more I can even have.4 and of course I will get all my list of new groups.With of course, the same behavior. As for the rest of the folder here from this group to these 2 means that I have 2 unread messages. So if I go to the text external, she's group again. I see that I asked to.Green and red so it means that he had it to the folder group you will find all the groups. You again member of to share this one. I member of another one, etc. This is welcome message OK. Welcome to the outlook customer manager.You can start a conversation a few group flies on active ET cetera. I will show you what it means and if I get to 6 extent. I fuck shit. The different composition, but that's not the only interesting thing in the groups working groups if you look.Tab and in the ribbon you see that we are in the conversation, meaning that these are the conversations between all the group first and its members or between different members.Here, I can.Create a new conversation.And buy new conversation is the new Mary, new message 20 minutes, you would with you on.Mailbox but you can see that this message is addressed or intended to the whole group, meaning that this will be instantly received as a conversation in the group.Or easier versus crap members directly they will receive the message thing in their own inbox personally inbox professional personal inputs, so you can now instantly send a message to all the group, so that's very interesting.Now I think they also a calendar, which is shared the whole group and calendar here.You see that there is also a group in the folder pane of of the calendar. You can right click. The request a new point. Modern new meeting request and if you ask for one of these again again again the.Quest will be.Sent to the whole group of course, you get a couple but also it means that you also have all the functions of Outlook scheduling your systems, the possibility to have categorized G possibility to have the chance of each meeting for group for example, you have to plan.Um every current meeting each morning each Monday morning. For example, with Poles Member Group. You don't need to ever send them 10 minutes. If you have 10 members just send one day and it will be received and everybody will receive.The the the request a meeting request in terms also of in terms of managing the.Meetings request you have a new functionality that will be that you will be able to use in your management of these coordination reflection workshops. Organizacion see for example, you have something new, which is called new meeting point if you check.Which is called fun time you will be requested to link outlook or your account now joke with this Phantom application and if an issue select link now you will be.Connected to find time you will need to connect to your user account against.And.So I'm connecting to find time and once connected you will be able when you create a new request. New meeting request or even if you answer to Maine. You can answer with these new meeting port and you can instantly see.So you instantly are able to select time for your meeting you see. Now that's deselected if you click on next so you can of course, you have several options that you will have to discover the working hours of course again.How to set up the the time zone the duration of the meeting by default and if you click on next in this case.Location it can be an online meeting with you, even tell you about this one machine. That's also an issue in search to mail in your mail. You have and you creation request of meeting so this is not a traditional.Is really amazed that you send to people proposing an invitation and people will select when they received the mail?They received the mail they will be able to select.Um options so whether they accept or not so we are not in the traditional meeting request. It's a new way of communicating in terms of reactivity that was one of the of the states other things like that where it sticks.So.Uh now in the each people receiving this request without once I guess I agree with this time, no, I don't so you can answer mail by just sending this reply again, which you have here and reply with meeting full so again that will.With which you can instantly find time for a meeting between you and your correspondence here train one.So very interesting new feature so again when you create a group you have.This conversations with everybody where everybody can do the conversations participate into the conversations like the conversations, etc, etc. You have a calendar to prepare meetings with anybody from the group instantly with all peep.Uh but it was also nice.Which is a storage online where you will be able to?Shadow clicks.Sure, there.So this and see the place where you will be able to upload document size.So once they are uploaded it would be able to scan the document with anybody.From your organization from the outside very easy so it will be different from the other group, which was dedicated to only the members of group with a percentage to share with the outside, where I would say here once you select a doc.Share it.Of course in here, you have access to your directory, but you can get an inch and we fixing people from outside your enterprise will be able to view or edit. The document so the new whales communicate you cannot imply people from outside.Good point so you people don't need to be member of the group. But at any time you can share this document with people from outside so again when we get back to 2 AM.To outlook again, we have this conversation, she mailbox probably the calendar files and even a notebook that you can share with the old member groups to share right notes that are online and will be accessible from anywhere at anytime so lots of posts.With his new book, if you need to access or to be a twist change between the various stakeholders instantly. There is a possibility well. I have 2 added excited just that I don't know why.Um.This version that I cannot keep it disappears only time but if you are in the calendar of your group, so of course, we've seen that here have positive.Appointment but I can have a new meeting request. But if you get to the top here admitting there is something new, which is called Skype meeting so if you should take on Skype meeting uhm you can either instantly of course, you can even.Is Skype meeting later? What you described meeting with Katie on meeting online that you flat? What is interesting here is that whoever received this meeting invitation so of course members of the group but?Finally, people from anywhere because you can even add people from outside so anybody receiving this.Meeting request with this automatically added link there will be instantly connected to your meeting.And what is also interesting is that?Vintage wait both all the possibilities of Skype in terms of what was it take it certain put out too?To centralized exchanges between the various too, cool sequel that we have seen the the files, but now if you want to discuss.Uh around them these work truck plant workshop 3. Sanders work truck. You can set a meeting now or later again excess as much as you could you either the normal meeting in a room but you don't need a room you just see?Skype meeting create chance there is a link and now you can of course share you that stuff share window share PowerPoint on which people will be able to exchange. Even editing the document who editing the document with Skype, the meaning that you can improve.Communication in terms of reactivity because you can try example instantly create the Skype meeting because because also you know who is available or not due to the relationship between Scampi and and outlook.Work in Skype, you know who's available by just away unknown available first, but also because that's the same in outlook. So here you see that thread because I'm in a conference call.So I'm not free so instantly you know, people are available for instant messaging for a phone call with Skype video conference or whatever and if so, you can again send this Skype meetings online and people clicking on this range do they have if they have?Code or not they only need again browser Internet browser and are connected to the Internet to instantly join my meeting.Um that then we'll be able to wear again, I will be able to share.Uh my desktop the window.

So a new way of communicating him again of sharing because you can share windows PowerPoint 52 author of this document we can see.Lots of possibilities with these groups uh intricately linked to outlook and Skype Lee to again after an improved communication more reactive in terms of of. We've seen that in Skype, you can show.Um so I will not see changes so at your disposal groups calendar.Find book and if you go from if you go into A.Online so if you go your mailbox online mailbox again, you will be able to create these groups also.Can you speak in the same with the street leasing people also from?So if you select online you see the same conversations calendar 5 notebook uhm.So she was number my fine time.Pussy propose different time for cheap.Why we boot on my undesa quest from the group to decide are fine time for Microsoft outlook so this?

1941,en,Uses by job role: Assistant(s),78.0,"Hello everyone and welcome to thistraining session. So today, we're goingto see a training session aboutthe assistant job.So.To begin with, we have someinstructions. Turn off the call waiting if you're using yourmobile Phone to join this training session. Or else yourmusic on Hold will be out by all of the participants. Alsoremember to mute your microphone. If you havebackground noises around you please mute your microphone, sothat you do not disturb thetraining session. And also keep your screen active at all time,do not let your computer go into sleep mode or else you'll beautomatically disconnected from the training session and soyou'll have to log in once again to join us.So today, objective is to improve our efficiency indelegation and communication.So we have 45 minutes on 3 assistant use case scenarios.We're going to see Sharepoint, to create documents on thecollaborative space. Teams : to contact absent collaborators anorganize our contact by groups.Outlook : to manage and share thecalendar. OneNote : to organize our notes.World : to credit documents and we're going to usethe themes on PowerPoint.So let's go right now.First of all we have some, as we said just before, use cases. Sofirst of all,our issues right here. How do we get in formations and whattools do we have at our disposal in order to make remoteworking efficient, when we need to write a document at the lastminute. So the first tool that we are going to use today.His name : Sharepoint. To access SharePoint we need to go online. Up here we need to access the Office portal.portal.office.com to access it.In it, we are going to find our different applications as youcan see on my screen. We have Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc,etc. All of them are accessible directly online. You do not haveto use the local software to access those different toolsbecause we have them alsoonline. So here I want to useSharepoint. What is Sharepoint ?Sharepoint is a shared collaborative space. Which meansthat we're going to have groups, SharePoint groups on it, and every members of the groupwill have an access to the different documents that we aregoing to share in it.So let's click on thatto see what it's all about.Here, when I click on the littleSharePoint icons. Well.I have on the screen a lot ofdifferent things. News fromsites. Frequent sites, following sites, recent sites, suggested sitesand also, as you can see on the bottom, featured links, recent documentsand save for later. We are not going to see all of that today.Let's just go right here. We have sites. So the frequent sitesare the one that, as the word said, I went not too long ago.""Following"", well, it's like putting a site in favorites, so here.We have little stars next to our sites name. If we go to ""Frequent""here. Here we have one site, if I click on the Little Star,""Follow""... It will now be in ""Following"" right here. I clickonce again on the star and it willbe not here.""Recent"", well, so when I went torecently. And ""Suggested"" : other one that I have access to, butI'm not going a lot on them. So they are suggested becausemaybe there are new informations, new documents, etc.Here, I already opened one of my Sharepoint sites asyou can send that up here. We are on ""Demonstrations"".This is a basic, a default SharePoint site right here.I did not add anything else except in the library, inthe document library. But here well, I will have access to mySharepoint site. As you can see in the far left : documents,services, activity, pages, etc, etc. So we have a lot of different things on Sharepoint.But what we want to use today is the document tab.In the document tab, as you can see,I already have a lot ofdocuments. If I want to, right here, I can click on the folder.And I'm right here, but I can also click on a document...And the document will open directly in the online version of Excel. How did I do to have those documents right here ?Well, on the top, you have different actions.New : I can create a new folder, a new document : Word, Excel,PowerPoint, OneNote, Forms... Even an Internet link... Directly fromSharePoint. I do not have, it isn't mandatory, to create the documentoffline and then upload it.I can directly create it online. So that's whatwe're going to do today.I'm going to create,let's say, a Word document.Here. I have my Word document that isstill opening and I can add information. ""This document isabout...""If I want to, I can use any of the tab that I also have on Wordoffline as you can see right here. ""Insert"", ""Layout"", ""References"", etc, etc. Word online is not the exact same as Word on mycomputer because, as you can see, we don't have exactly the same functionalities. We have much more functionalities in thelocal version, the software version, but this application isnot that bad. We nearly haveeverything. And I can use that to create my document directlyin SharePoint. No need once again to create it offline andupload it, etc. No! I can doeverything in here. How do I rename my document ? Quite easy ! I click on ""Document"" at the Top right here and I can change thename. So I will call it... ""Information 101"".I just click elsewhere, and as youcan see ""Information 101"".Anytime I had information, as you can see on the Top,we have ""Saving"". And if I stop writing ""Saved"". It's automatic.I do not haveto go into ""Files"" and ""Save"", ""Save under"", ""Save as"" etc, etc. No! Justevery time I add anything orremove anything. It will automatically save.I can close this document""Information 101"". I will reload my library right here.And if I go into my files... ""Information 101""... Right here.Modified a few seconds ago, of course, and modified by, and thisis my demo account.So...We have a solution to our problem... Well, one of our problembecause... OK, we can quickly create document online, etc... ButHow are my coworker going toedit it ? Well, quite simply as I said at the beginning, Sharepointis a collaborative space.As you can see on the Top right,w e have 4 members,in this team, in this SharePointsite. So, everyone of themwill be able to click on my document and to edit it.We can have...modification at the same time, which means I can open mydocument, my coworkers open the document as well, and both of uswill be on the document editing it.We'll see the little mouse cursors with colors,on them, with their names, etc. But also I can edit a document. As the next morning, a coworker edit the samedocument I will see some notification when I go back onit. So we will be able to work on the same documentat the same time quite quickly.Let's just imagine that we have a Powerpoint document. Let's say we have 4 slide to create.We have no slide for now.OK, I share my document to my coworkers. We are four. Everyone create his own slide.In a matter of minutes, the document is complete.So, if we go back on our PowerPoint...How to get information? What tools do youhave at our disposal to make remote working efficient? Well,we answered this question. How to get information? SharePoint. On Sharepoint, we need a file : it's already shared by coworkers. Wehave the files. No need to send a mail : ""Oh please, can you sendme a copy of this file"", and then the answer 10 minutes later, etc... No!Here, the files are in the same place, in SharePoint.I don't need to ask anyone. If the files is in here, I click onit, I have the information.And we want to work remotelyand efficiently. Well, as I just said, we go into SharePoint. Weopen the document. My coworkers opens the same documents at thesame time, and we can all work on the same document.So...How do we handle that ? As we said, we have SharePoint, with thepossibility to create a new document online and to find itback in the file library.Now we have a new issue.How to make up for the frequent absence of collaborators, toexchange information and have work instructions? What tools dowe have at our disposal to ensure that our mission is doneefficiently? How would we handle that? So...Now, we wantto exchange information and to have work instruction frompeople that are not on site. They are not here. They are not with me.How do we communicate?Well... We have 2 possibilities.The first that you're going tosee today is Teams.Teams, maybe you already know it,a little. Teams is an instant messagingapplication. As the name say, it will help us to quickly sendmessages. Let's begin with a little tour of the interface.On the far left,you will have different tabs.""Activity"": the activity feed well, you will find everynotification that you have on Teams. Someone tried to call you.Someone likes your message.Someone shared you a file.Every notification, information that you need.In ""Chat"", as a name say, it will be right here, the instantmessaging tab. You'll be able to chat, to exchange, with yourcoworkers in it, like you used to do on Skype for example.The ""Teams"" tab in Teams : well, here the ""Teams"" tab.We are not going to see that in details today. But this tabwill allow me to create what we call ""teams"". Those teams willcontain channels, discussion channels and, in those, I will beable to exchange informations, to send document, links,and work, collaborates, communicate, with my differentcoworkers.""Calendar"": in the calendar, I will find, well, as the name say it, mycalendar, so in it, you will, of course findevery meetings that you have, but there is something quite interesting with this calendar.In Teams, in the Team's calendar,every meeting that we can find is from Outlook.And in Outlook, every meeting that we can findcan be from Teams, because everything that you create onTeams, on the calendar of course, will automatically be added toyour Outlook calendar. And everything you add in yourOutlook calendar will be automatically added to yourTeam's calendar. So, there is an imbrication between the two of them, they worktogether, so that you do not have 2 different calendars, do youimagine the problematic here? Now we have only one calendarthat are shared between Teams and Outlook. Well, I think ""Calls"", you already know, but it's all aboutto call people.""Files"": in files you will find your recent files, your MicrosoftTeams files, the files you downloaded, and the files in yourOneDrive. And with the three little dots, well it's justto find applications. We are not going to go in detailsabout that today.Let's go back into ""Chat"". So into ""Chat"", we have 2 tabs on the Top.We have ""Recent"". ""Recent"": I talked to people recently, so well,as you might guess, those are our recent chat. As you can see here,for example, conversation tests : one in French that is ""Strategyreorganization"" and we have ""Project test"".So we have our different chat, our recent chat,that we can continue whenever we want, but most importantly, wehave ""Contacts"" on the Top.""Contacts"" is exactly what you think it is.In it, you would find different contact groupsthat we can create as you can see at the bottom,""Create a new contact group"".I will name it...""New York site"".Create.We have ""New York site"" right here. Three little dots.And we can add a contact to this group.So I had for example, Oliver I guess... Yeah, Oliver.OK let's had Oliver, and now Oliver is in the ""New York Site"" group. Here, as I just clicked on Oliver, as you cansee. Our conversation just appeared and something quiteinteresting. Here. As you can see I sent this message.Uh on the 12th of January.2018. It's been 2 full years.Because yes, Teams will remember your conversation. Yourconversation will not disappear when you close this window.Everything will remain directly in it.So, well, you can find every information that you need right here.What can we doon the Teams chat ? Well. Of course, we can send differentmessages. But we can add, we can enrich our conversation. As youcan change the bottom right here under my a text bar.I have different icons.The first one, I can format my text, put it in bold, italic,underline, etc, etc.I can set the delivery option : standard, important, urgent.I can send attached document.Add emojies, GIF, stickers, and evenscheduled meetings directly from a private, adirect conversation, between Oliver and I.So that's quite a lot of thingsthat we can do right here onTeams. That not all ! Because also we will havewhat we call ""the availability status"". We have some statutesright here on the left. As you can see we have Laurent Balardy, andOliver detects. Those ones have a little yellow circle right here.If I go in the Top right, I have my little picture. I click on that, and I can click here on ""Available"". I will see all of thedifferent availability statutesthat exist. ""Available"", as a name say, I'm available, you can talkto me, no problem.""Busy"". ""Busy"" means, well, I'm probably into something important. Some things that has all of my intention right now.So maybe I won't answer your messages. Maybe, I won'tever see them. ""Do not disturb"": ""Do not disturb"" is a bit special,because this one if you click on it, people of course, there will be able to send you messagescall you etc, etc. But,you will not receive any notification on that.No little pop up at the bottom of the screen that said thatsomeone sent you a message. No little noise that tells youthat you receive a notification. Nothing. We will be able to see all of them directly into Teams into the activitybutton, on the Top left, but ""Do not disturb"" as the name say I donot want to be disturbed.""Be right back"" and ""Appear away"" well, those are away fromkeyboard staches. So quite simply, I'm not in front of my computer, I won't answer right now. That's all.So, when we sent messages to our coworkers on Teams, as we saidjust before we can send documents. Something quiteinteresting is that at the Top we have different tabs. I won'tgo into much details about them. But we have the ""Files"" tab andhim here, I will fine everyfiles that I shared with Oliver. Here I didn't have shared any document,so I won't find them. But maybe I have some with other coworkers.Yeah, right here as you can seewith Pierre. I already shared a picture and so it's right here.I shared it,  as you can see, on the 16th of November 2017.So quite a long time ago, as well. And the currency is still here.I can access it. Pierre canaccess it. No problem with that.Now, that we saw...Teams, we havethe answer to let's say, 50% of our issue. OK, I can sendmessages, I can call them from Teams well, yeah, yeah. That'squite quick, quite simplebut... How can I doto know if a coworkers is available when for example, isalready in a call or in a meeting? How can I know if he'savailable in 30 minutes?Well, we're going to go on Outlook.In Outlook, let's go directly at the bottom left in the calendar.Here, as I said, we can find every of our meetings, and, by the way,let's create a meeting right here in Teams.I will create a meeting for the24th Friday. Hop!""Create meeting"". Let's just call it :""Test Meeting  Assistant""Right here, I will schedule it.OK, I close that. I go back on Outlook. I will reload... I don' even hadto reload, as you can see, right heren 24 Friday, we have ""Test Meeting Assistant"".OK, perfect everything is shared betweenTeams and Outlook.What do we want to know on Outlook? We want to know when areour coworkers available? Well.We can add their calendar to our own. Let's click on that.""From Address book"".I want to open the calendar of Laurent, I guess. Let's try Laurent.OK. Let's wait a minute and as you can see,we have Laurent's calendar next to mine, and every time I addsomeones calendar. They will appear on the left.I want to open Lisa's calendar.And even... Where is it ?... Pierre's calendar.Wow, that's quite a mess. I opened everyone calendar, but now, whatcan I do to have a better viewof all of that? Well, next to the name, we have a little arrows, pointing to the left. If we click on them...As you can see, our calendar on Top of each other.I have everyone meetings and informations on my screenright now and I know that we are all available right herefor example.We can click back on thosearrows to have them next to one another. And the little cross, to close everything. And I know that you're going to ask : ""But Thomas, we wereseeing what they were doing. I don't want to everyone in my companyto know what I'm doing every time at work!"". That's ,well... That's a problem of privacy right here!Well, we can share our calendar on the Top.And here when I share my calendar to someone... Let's share it to Laurent.Oh no, not ""Lamp Project"", I said ""Laurent""...Hop, right here...Laurent... Add... OK... I can choose different permissions.Laurent... Can he view when I'm busy ? It means that what he is going to seewhen he opens my calendar,he is going to see ""Amaury - Busy from 9 to 10"".That's all, nothing else.Can he view titles and the locations ? ""Amaury - not available from 9 to 10because he is in a HR Meeting,in a room 104"".Can view all details,well as the name say, Laurent will see everythingabout my different meetings.""Can edit"" : he will be able to edit what I have already created.And ""Delegate"", it would be able to do anything that hewants on my calendar, as if he was me.So you can choosewhat your colleagues are going to see. By default, you have...Let's remove Lisa...  You have my organization, which is everyone in the company without exceptions. And here youcan choose what they are going to see.""Can view when I'm busy"", ""Can view titles and locations"", etc, etc...So you chose, and, by default, it's ""Can view that I'm busy"". So, do not worry about your colleagues seeing everything in your calendar. So we saw two shared calendar. If we go back on our PowerPoint...How to make up for the frequent absence ofcollaborators on site, of course, and exchange informationand have work instructions?... Teams! The instant messaging of Teams.We need information: we call, we send messages, we havethe information right now.And also, if we want to know if a coworker is available, we open their calendar on Outlook, and so I'm able to see when theyare available or not.And so, what tools do we have at our disposal to ensure that our mission is done efficiently? Well...We already said that.So on Teams, the availability status that isvery, very important. If you send a message to someone in ""Be right back"" or ""Appear away"", of course, he's not going toanswer right now.And same thing for ""Do not disturb"" or ""Busy"" you need to use thoseavailability statutes to know, as the name say, when your coworkersare available or not.And also we had Outlook.Last use case.To format a document quickly. Issues: how to progress on theformatting of documents ? How to automate a layout andsave time? How to get tasks validated by managers ?OK, so first of all.We are going to check directly. Let's go back on the Officeportal by the way right here... Hop...Office portal. On the Office portal we are going to talkabout very important applications. Next to Sharepoint, by the way.""OneNote"": OneNote is exactly like your paper notebook thatyou have somewhere on your desk.So you will be able on OneNote to write everything, everywhere.You want to write something well. You write it when itwherever you want you can add pictures, you can add linksvideos. You can share with coworkers your OneNote.So here I will...As it concerns the left, I have here ""sections"". And, in the sections, I have pages.Let's create a new section. Let's call it :""Assistant notebook"".And in it, I can create pages so for example, ""Meeting"".And also create new pages and a new meeting, etc, etc, etc.So yeah, we can createas much pages as we want on OneNote and as I said, just beforewe can write wherever we want.I can select multiple informations.Hop... Right here.But also I can format  my text, you guess that, I canadd... Right here...as you can see, little icons.So for example, let's say: ""Call manager...Very important"". I can add a little icon next to it, I willhad the exclamation mark for example, just a little reminderwith a little drawing next to it. As you can see I can add quite a lot of them.I can insert tables,documents, images, links, record audio, add symbols, mathematics... Symbols as well, as you can see, right here;emojis, stickers, and even meeting details. If I want to, I can add meeting details from an Outlook meeting that I have.So of course I have to connect right here to add it. I won't dothat right here because that's not our training session case,but you can do that.Drawing as well, we can draw.Hop, directly... So quite quickly... Hop...This information is related to this one, this one to this one, etc, etc...Hop, I can remove that.We can change, also, how we can view our page.So yeah, it's really importantto use OneNote, and, personally, in my company, I use itevery time, because you can...Let's say ""filter"" this information how you want it to be filtered. You can have as many sections as you want, as manypages as you want.And you can put information wherever you wantand find it back quite quickly as well. So yeah, quite important to use OneNote.Let's close that.I'm going to open a Word document. Well, I'm going to opena Word document, but I could open a PowerPoint, an Excel, I could openany of the Office 365 document.The important things here... Let's put it on the screen.The important thing is that...I want to show you that on Office 365, we can share ourdocument. When we were on Sharepoint I was talking about: ""Yeah,every document is shared, everybody can go on it, edit it, etc.""Well. We can do that with any document that we want.On the Top right, as you can see right here, we have ""Share"".I click on it. I choose the OneDrive that I want to useit to share it because I can have multiple OneDrive, butjust one is quite enough, believe me. So here my document would benamed. Let's call it: ""To delete"". OK.We're going to wait a few second because it's loading the document into Onedrive, and then I'll be able to share it afterward.So just a few seconds.Here, I have a little window that just appeared withdifferent information. First of all, let's click on the firstsquare like this on the first window. Multiple possibilities:I want to share my document to: ""Anyone with the link"". With this option,this would create, of course, a sharing link.I can send this link to anybody in the whole world. They're will be ableto access my document, to edit my document etc. Be careful because anybody can share your link. You sent a link to someone,that sent it to someone, then to someone else, and at the end ofthe day, a 200 people have access to your document.So be careful with that.""People in your company with the link"".With that, well it's the exact same as theone before, except it will stop at your company walls.Everybody in the company would have access to the document, but not anyonein the outside of your company. ""People with existing access"":it's just to create, or regenerate, or refresh your sharing link with everyone that has already access to the document.""Specific people"", as the name say, you are going to sharedocuments with well specific people, that you choose andonly them will have access to it.You can also allows the editing of the document and if you do not allow it,you can even block the download of the document.I want to share my document with Lisa.Let's share it with... Dina for example, and thenwe've Olivier. OK. I can add a message: ""Here is the documentI was talking about"".And I have three options to send it. I can click on ""Send"". By doing that this will automaticallysend a mail with the showing link inside and the little messagethat I wrote : ""Here is the document I was talking about"".I can click on Outlook. This will open a new mail page,with the showing link inside, and I will be able towrite in this mail. And lastly, ""Copy link"": this would create alink that I can copy to sendit to anyone, with Teams for example. And it will be able by clicking on it, to access my document. When I re my document to someone as we said onSharepoint, they will be able to view it, to edit it, to evendelete some information in it, so be careful with who you share your document.But this could be quite usefulto work quickly on different things.And lastly, I'm going to open a Powerpoint document.OK, we have a Powerpoint document right here on the screen.What I want to talk about is the templates. What are the templates ? Well,you have themright here on the screen. As you can see, we have differenttemplates. I can click on ""See other"".Oh my Powerpoint that is opened just under it, is causing some trouble... OK.OK. All the templates and we have a lot of differenttemplates right here. Let's say. I want to use this one : ""Sector"".I can choose of course, the color. I want it in orangefor example. ""Create"".And here, when I insertnew slides, as you can see, all of them will have the same template. And so, I can just use that... so I I don't have to think of : ""OK, I need a templatewhat could be professional but not tooprofessional, because we are open minded etc."". Yeah, just go into the templates. Just when you open PowerPoint, they will askyou if you want a template.And so just like that, as you can see I have a whole template.So if we go back on our first Powerpoint right here.How to progress on the formatting of document? Howto automate a layout and save time? How to get task validatedby managers ? Well. OneNote, the sharing and the template. Everything.And, of course, those different applications are available onmobile as well so you can workreally anywhere at anytime.If you have any question related to what we saw today, please ask them right now.Oh, while  you are thinking about your questions, of course,here... This is what we saw today.I guess that everything about that is clear andthat you understand everything that we saw.If you do not have any question and don't hesitate to ask them, ifyou have any of them. I thank you for being here today. Ofcourse, make the best use of what you have learned and wewill see each other on another training session. Thank you andhave a good day.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],2380.0,webcast
1942,en,Uses by job role: Marketing and communication,20.0,"Welcome to the surface 365 training. The subject of this session is to have a look around Marketing and Communication; and in fact, to go over3 job situations that you may face if you are from the Marketing and Communication Department. So welcome to this session. My name is Charles BONACHERA and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. So what we will be discussing during this time, I've told you already: 3 job situationsthat you may face in marketing and communication. The first issue would be to try to keep yourself organized in your relationship with others, in any type of relationships. In fact, I will say that I will try to show you some solutions or two at least, that will help you stay organized.The second issue will be to to see how to prepare a big event.Also, having to use some tools prepared ahead of time, provided by Microsoft Office 365. And then the third issue will be to get the marketing plan in a very short time, so how to succeed in having a marketing planin a very quick and short time. So the goal of this session is to collaborate efficiently and get a better communication globally. So let's go...And for that, first I will open Outlook.To keep yourself organized in your relationship with others, you havedifferent possibilities; but the main one is the new opportunity in Office 365 and Office 2016, which is called groups. The groups. If you want to keep organizedand nevertheless, have relationships with others, you may try to create groups for that purpose. How can you conceive these? When you are in outlook, in the home tab you have... nearly at the end of the ribbon,a new section called ""Groups"" where you will be able to create a ""New Group"". So there you will go in the popup to give the new group a name. You will be able to decide whether this new group is public or not. Of course, it will dependon the purpose of the relationship that you want to have with the others, the other people: internally or externally. So let's say, it could be private so that you will decide whether to subscribe new members so that you see group conversationsin their inbox, private inbox also; otherwise, they only see them in the group inbox. So you will create a group. What is interesting in this is that in your mailbox at... in the folder pane, here on the left,the folder pane at the end, you get a new folder called groups where you find all the groups you are members of.And others, because you have created them or because you have been assigned to a group and invited to a group directly by someone else. If we have a look at this folder... I have already groups, so that's why I'm not creating one.But once you have created one, you see that of course, if I go to this ""Webcast"", there is one unread conversation. Here, I've got 2 conversations and here I've got 2 other conversations, which are not... which are still unread.OK uhm so in these groups what's interesting with groups is that in our subject, which is to keep organized in your relationship with others, the interesting thing is that for each group created,...each group created will instantly createthe conversation orthe equivalent of the mailbox where all the conversations of the group will be concentrated (focused). So here I have a new tab, which is called ""Home"" and this tabsynchronizes all the actions and commands that I can have with my group. So the first is the conversation. So it means that I can have a conversation with the group, OK? So I can have a new conversation, meaning that the conversationseen or sent by all the members and all the members of the group will receive my email, my message; and if I had subscribed the members, they will also receive a copy of this conversation in their own mailbox, in their own personal mailbox.By personal, I mean their professional individual mailbox; and also a copy in the group mailbox as pretty much said earlier, having here access to the mailbox of the group. To help you again keep organized.there is also work calendar which enables, regarding the group members, to invite them individually but through the group. So you may now recognize the Outlook interface you may know fromOutlook 2016. And you can have new appointments, new meeting requests... but each time, what is available, is that you see this is the group address.So that means that each timeyou have the possibility to send and create an appointment or meeting exactly as you would with one individual but pieces (attachments) directly sent to all members of the group. Then of course, you get all the functions of Outlook... which of course, youyou can insert documents, attach files... You can well do anything... Attach file here with the new functionalities of Outlook 2016 that I invite you to find in one of our MOOC training regarding using Outlook. Also, to get back to what we first saw...We have seen...For the groups, we have seen...the conversations, calendar, but there is also something very, very useful and that you may found very useful to again keep organized and have still a good relationship with your other members of groups and people that you want to keepupdated with the documents for example: Here, when you create a group within ""Conversations""/""Calendar"", there is also aspace, your own online storage where you can upload documents that can be shared by the group. So thisyeah, this file can be shared by all the members. From there, we'll be able again to share them with anyone outside your organization and outside Outlook. So you are notrestricted to your organization or to your group. This group functions are very, very interesting to keep again organized within your team or small groups.But that is not a restriction to these couple of members because from there, you can still share documents with people outside your organization, having in mind still security; So, you can copy a link to... a restricted link for example, to keep (maintain) securityor to send a few links or anything to someone external to your organization or invite both inside your organization and this time in this case you are directlyrelated to the organization, your organization book... address book. So that's another feature, which is very, very interesting in our issue, first issue to get organized and nevertheless, related to all members ofour group for instance; And the last option is the Notebook. Notebook is also a notebook so to get (take) quick notes that you will also share with the rest of the members of the group. So that's the main featurethat you may use in your organization. There is something else...If you go to outlook. There is also the possibility with Skype to know if people are available or not. So you can alsotake advantage of this Skype E which is included in Office 365 and in office 2016. For example: Here, one member of one of my groups, I know that his presence is unknown. But this means that if he were available at this time,I would...You see, like mine here, I would say I'm available and video capable. That means also that in my relationship with people I can instantly create for example, send them an instant message or have an audioconference or videoconference call. Well,pretty much do everything instantly. And that keeps me more organized more in touch and in open communication with the rest of my people. When I need to communicate effectively with the rest of my group, so that's the first answer and solutions tothe main... first issue, which was to keep yourself organized and nevertheless related to the others... Share with Outlook and Skype: conversations, calendar, files, notebooks; And to instantly see the availability of peopleand to encourage reactivity in terms of communication.That was the first issue.If I get back to my second issuewhich is to prepare a big event.So the questions at stake... How to manage the organization of an event with internal and external participants? How to give an attractive and creative dimension to a presentation? - which is part of this event. You have a presentation to deliver and how    to get an attractive and creative or more creative and attractive dimension to your presentation and how to centralize the exchange (of information) of all the participants. For this, there is something new in Office 365; this one is called Yammer.If we connect the Internet to Office 365 account online, you'll be greeted by this page; Unless you have changed it. But let's say that you haven't change it. So you will be welcomed in this page. And here you find, of course, all the applicationsthat you can access online; there are several ones of course. Your Mailbox, Calendar, People, PowerPoint, Excel and Word - which are the main applications that you can use and may use when you connect to the Internet. But there is something new here, which is called Yammer. So what isYammer? In fact, Yammer is a network, a kind of social network where you can... that you can use to again have conversations. So, for example, if I go to this network that I created: Marketing and Communication, you see that you can haveconversations. So you can see all new conversations. So it means that all this network can be used by also people participating in a project; like this one, to prepare a big event. And from there, you will be able to share conversations, but again files and notes.So it's not exactly... or it's also the creation of a new group; So, if you create a group... Here, create a new group at the bottom, left-bottom, ""Create a new group"". You can see also that can be either an internal group or an external group. So if you choose tohave external group that means that people from the outside world, I would say, that means outside your organization will be able to access this group and so share with you lots of information because this time contrarily to Groups where you could share a calendar,just conversations like messages, in fact, like in Outlook. Inside, you also have much more. It's a real network, social network... where you can again have conversations, but not only conversation because if you, let's say, you can share something with this groupSwhich is just: ""Hello, welcome.""And you can post it pretty much as you would with other networks, social networks; but you see also that you can have here a pollwith questions... That's very interesting if you have a decision to take and you want to let peoplewell take time sometimes to answer these questions; So, you don't need an answer instantly but you can ask a question. So,""That's my question"".OK and of course, you can get different answers, OK? So, ""Yes, perhaps, no, Don't know"".See, each time you get to the bottom of a question, you ask another one, OK?You see that this group is the recipient of this post, meaning that they will receive a postin their group calendar and in their mail. You can even add people to notify. So you can add people.And of course, you can add a document, so upload a file from your computer or a file from Yammer. Why from Yammer? Because as much as groups, here you have... Yeah. I haven't posted my message yet. So I post my message first.And now you see that people will receive the post, will be notified of this post and will be able to answer,And will be able to see the results. OK, and you can even change the vote. Here's the post. So something new, not directly available with groups as we have seen before. I was telling you that about files. So again pretty much as we had for the groups but share in this complete network.You see that you can also upload documents. The situation a little bit different because from there, you will not be able to share documents with the outside world. I mean, only with people inside network will be able to see this document.Of course, and you can even have some notes. Notes in this case, it is not the Notebook. It really, really creates a note. It is just also a simple note to (take) a quick note. It has nothing to do with the notebook, which is much more advanced in terms of writing a note.So,Again.In New conversations, you can have a pole, you can praise someone:""Thanks Paul for your job.""And the person that I want to praise.And now I can post this.And the system will look into the address book of the company.And the name that I have entered. But not only... So, you can see also on the right that there is a possibility to search information and things. You can directly edit information with a group.So you have lots of possibilities. The documents here are available. You can relate this group to another one.So if you have different group of people related not always directly involved in the same project but somehow related, you can subscribe to this group by email, post to this group by email. So it means that people will be able to... and you can have conversations in Yammer without everleaving your email inbox. So if you copy this, it means that you will be able from your mailbox to directly send post to this group, even if you're not connected to yammer! What is also interesting with this Yammer is that you and the group do not need to be on your computer.You don't need to be on your computer because this is an online feature an online applications, meaning that wherever you are, and on whatever the device, you have the possibility to use this Yammer. There is an application form for smartphones and tablets so that you can directlyconnect to this application from wherever you are, and whenever you want to. ... And of coursee, the rest of the group. And you can even see on the right, under the search bar the people already connected, look for someone have instant messaging with someone which is connected.And you can send message. Invite people or instant message with people which are online, and members or not of the group.So this is another solution to this part of this issue to prepare the event. So you have the possibility to create for each main event a new group, Yammer Group I mean, a new network. In fact, where you will be able againto share conversations files and much more possibilities for all people to get involved from anywhere at anytime. That was one of the first three...But now to give an attractive and creative dimension to a presentation that you have to deliver somewhere. If I go to. Um...There it is, sorry. Here's the presentation that I have created. Well, of course, you presentation would probably be much more attractive than this one. This one was done very quickly off a blank template... This is the result.Now just in terms of attractivity, if you go to ""Design"", you will have access already to some new templates to get instantlyOr with which will instantly see the results. So if you want to change thetemplate, this you already have at your disposal. Lots of templates that you can reuse instantly. Of course, if you change to anothertile, of course you will also get the results. So this was the Title slide, of course which is based on the template of title. So it reacts in a certain way, which is not always what you would get if you look at the normalslide. So you see that you can decide whether you prefer one or another, OK? And you can of course, reverse because I would like to tell you something. The first thing is that you can select a new thing with some varianceat each time to your presentation.And if you have for example here, a list of words or just at list that you want to present... If you goto the Home page and then format, first you can change to see just the ""WordArt Styles"", OK? But also,if you stay in the home tab, if you select your list, you will find in the middle of the ribbon something called ""Convert to SmartArt"" and there, you will be able to test another layout, another possible presentation to your list.And this may be of course quite interesting because you can get something much, much more attractive... So all are not, of course. That's it. But here for example, this one may be good. And each time, you can change to one that seems more presentable; This one for example.So, if we summarize... so if we go to design, you can change just the theme of yourpresentation first. And theneven for this list, if you go again to Home, you can convert this to and this time, each time PowerPoint will offer you of course, all this SmartArt based on the themes and that means the colors.And the font of the theme that you have chosen. So it might be a good way to have something more attractive, perhaps, then what you would have used at the beginning. So for example, then of course, the same if youhave inserted a chart into the slide Production...You see that each time you have something selected, there is a new tab, opening here ""Chart Tools"", for example. Here, for the chart... when you may find anotherlayout for your chart, a new style. And again, you may find something more attractive than just the chart you had at the beginning. So, many possibilities, always keeping the font and the color, basic color, OK?... of the theme you had.All right, so let's take this one, for example. Another way to get something more attractive.Then of course, you can insert a picture, the same each time that there is something you can convert to SmartArt. Just one thing, when you insert a picture.I will try this one first.So one.If you insert a picture.I will insert this one, for example.The system is able togive you here, design ideas. So the system when you insert a picture, the system will be able to show you different design ideas in terms of again design of the page. So you can, remember, you can insert pictures or even videos.So, search video online, video on your PC... So, here. And when you go to slide Show,you will be able to play video, OK? So it works. This is a Microsoft video. That also can give a much, much more attractive look to the presentation. And much more weight to the presentation and of course,the ideas you want to give to your audience. So again, each time there is a mix.You can again go to Home tab, you can then convert it to somethinbg more attractive, OK?To finish on that, just know that if you go to the Insert tab, you have at the far right... - we've seen how to insert a video - ...Just know that you can now insertan audio from your PC or even record your own sound. So now, I'm talking and of course, it is recording for the webcast. But it is also recording for the something inside the webcast. So if I close now you see that there is a media pic and if I click,I can hear my voice. Which is different that of the presentation of this webcast. So lots of possibilities! Even here: ""Screen Recording"" that we let you have something... you can select which part of the screen will be recorded andand everything that is on screen will be recorded and inserted into the slide. So, in 3 seconds... It will be recorded.So from now on, everything I do on screen, will be of course directly captured.Cool, I mean, all will be set online. So it means then that when Istop the video recording, you see this is...You can see this is inside the slide. You can then start it again at the bottom. There is here: play and pause. This video, which is in fact, recorded from your computer and what's on your screen. So lots of possibilities toimprove and make your presentation more attractive! So I would just edit this. You see that this was inserted into my slide. So remember when you click on Insert you will get here: video, audio and screen recording.So last possibility: How to centralize the exchange of all the participants. Well again, we see that groups possibility is to go to the groups here in the group's Calendar and Files central... Yammer, because in Yammer, it's a total network educated to project that poll and where people, again, share lots of information, communication and files. Again from there, so that's some of the issues that you may face. A lot more are available but of coursesome solutions that you can useto face the issue when you want to prepare a big event and after lots of people are involved both internally or externally; because again, the Yammer group can be external and that's people from the external world again, I would say.The last issue: How to draw a Marketing plan in a short time? How can you get for example, the collaborators ideas despite their distance? How to centralize the notes and documents of each and everyone involved? I think that we have already discussed that.So in this case you can face again this issue with either Yammer or Groups. How to gather everyone quickly and efficiency without effective presence? One of the solution that you may use isSkype E.Because with Skype E, you can instantly have...So if for example, you want to have an instant...I think with someone in Skype, you have your list of contacts that you have grouped... which are in groups or are organized by their status, but here you can instantly organize, shedule a meeting.So if you organize a meeting with someone means that you can instantly send invitation for everything to someone or even quicker;and more reactive: you can instantly for example start... So I'm the only one here for the moment. But anyone I think will instantly come along with me.In these.And I will send you.For example, or making could anybody again that receives this link with the instancing communication with me. So I can have an instant ink in quick quick meeting with anyone of my organization of course of my.The group that I intend to communicate with, but also with anyone outside and again, you can see that you can start a video neutral, which if you need to mute it, but you are an instant message here, so we can.Write message anybody to everybody you can and again, you can share your desktop or share window and even PowerPoint so if you want to share a PowerPoint I can will do second for example.So the system with.Load thePresentation you would be up to get the presentation to open go inside this conversation.So it takes just a human now this representation.2 numbers to all the against the participants in this session and everybody and even even.In the VM.On that presentation to the elbow 2 for example.Something and people at the end can even these 3 dots. We can even download boot plantation. The outlook presentation, which it's not double about point presentation in XPS format for from.At Microsoft, but instantly you can have a meeting with anyone inside your organization. Of course, but you can also copy Skype meeting options. You can copy a sorry you can.Reaching in folk you can.Keep this link or copy this change signage to everybody that you want. Anybody that you want again instantly be in communication in meeting with you. That means that can be someone from the external world external to your organization and that.And having your browser whatever browser is Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer. Whatever you can connect to this instant meeting and be discussing the problem for example, here.The plan that you can discuss dinner quick and short time, even inviting more people from the inside of your organization off again that we have seen with copying the meeting entry info to inverse someone from the external world.If you and you can so in a few seconds after Skype meeting OK or prepare a Skype meeting or share for example, from the 15th of February and that this particular time the meeting will start and people.Open Skype meeting instantly tan again. In fact, more and more people with a lot of possibilities. Instant messaging sharing desktop. The program or a PowerPoint presentation to be able to transform it to edit them together with other.People were so.Loving it so here we are at the end of this presentation around marketing and communication use cases I would say so. Thank you for attending this session hope it is used to and you can buy suppose and.Uhm I hope that you make the best use of these thank you and bye bye.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],2646.0,webcast
1944,en,Groups - Be more efficient with group working,17.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a topic called: ""Get started with Office"" and the session itself is called: “Be more efficient with Groups”. In fact, Working Groups that you can find in Outlook.We will soon discover all of this. Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. What are we going to discuss during this time? First of all, we're going to discover Working Groups, what they are and what they are constituted of, etc.How to create Groups afterwards, because you have to create a working group.Once created, we will see what you can do with the group, so you can use their features to work and communicate more efficiently from your desktop or online. At the end, we will see the Groups online, how you can access the Groups andaccess the different features and components of the Groups. The goal is to discover Groups communication features and hopefully that's what we're going to do during the next minute.First of all, what are Working Groups? They are groups that you create. When you need a group, you can create it instantly. Once you've created the group, the interesting thing is thatfor the whole group and all its members, there is a dedicated mailbox. With this mailbox, you willshare conversations within the group and the group can also access external email address. So that is the first thing, you share a mailbox with members of the group. Then we have a shared calendar where you will also share appointments, meetings,whatever item you want to create into the calendar, pretty much as you would do in Outlook. Then we will see that there is also a shared notebook that you can share with the various members, so that each member can edit the notebook and participate to its creation.Then we will have a quick overview of the planning tool, which is created each time the group is created and that's where you will be able not only to plan things as much as you would do with the calendar in terms of items,departments, meetings, etc., but in terms of staff dedicated and you will be able to follow the tasks that have been assigned to one or several members of the group. At the end, we will see that all of this is available also online. Working Groups are created on your Outlook 2016,on your computer, but it can also be created on the Outlook online. It can also be accessed from any place in the world, at any time, from any device because there is always the application created by Microsoft on tablets and smartphones.Let’s go and try to discover all this during the time range dedicated to products. Let's go to Outlook first.You probably know Outlook. Quickly, the interface: Each tab is dedicated to a topic and for each topic the ribbon below provides you withthe most common actions and commands dedicated to the task. So here the Home tab, Send/Receive, if you want to send and receive you have all the main commands at your disposal to send and receive anything in Outlook. The Folder, View, every time the ribbon adapts toyour needs, so it's a contextual ribbon, contextual commands are available each time. Then below left, all the accounts that you may find. Here I have several accounts.So they will appear here in what's called a folder pane. In the middle is the email folder with emails received for each account and on the right, the reading pane that shows the content of each email that you have selected.The purpose is to discover Groups. First, you have to go… You have different options. In fact, you can do that from the calendar accessible on the left bottompart of the screen with this icon. But even from the emails, you have in the Home tab at the far right Groups where you can find New Group.This button opens a pop up where you will have to choose a name for your group.Perhaps there is another one, and you see that the system automatically adapts the Group ID to fit the servers needsin terms of of identification and names. So this will be the group ID on the server. The Privacy: You have to decide whether the group is public, meaning that anyone your organization will be able to see what's inside the group or what the group shares inside the different features,or if it is private and, in this case,, only approved members can see what's inside. If you subscribe new members, it means that they will also receive the group conversations in their own inbox.Otherwise they will receive in the group inbox, so they will have to select the group inbox in Outlook to see the content of the conversation. Then we click on OK and we have to wait.This is the picture of the group. You will be able to edit it later. Now you can add people. We will see that you are the first member, the creator. So you are member, , automatically added to the to the group.And you can add more people.For example, my colleague trainer Amarra. I could continue looking for more people.Here we have at the moment 3 members and I could continue to add a lot of members. Description:“This is a group dedicated to…” and you explain what the group is dedicated to. Once you have created it, you say OK and the group is updated. Now the groups is instantly created with all the features that we're going to discover now. Still in Outlook, if you go to the Folder pane on the left, with all the accounts, I have created each from the ribbon directly.There's no need to select an account. You don't need to select, somehow if you have only one account the system will understand that it's in this organization that the group will be created. So you have to be connected to the account in the organization.At the bottom, you have Groups and you should click on More, it opens, and you see that we have “Webcast - Groups 2”. If you have several organization, which you might have but which isthe case for the normal, standard use. In your organization, just below your account, you find Groups and there you will find all the Groups you are member of or you have subscribed to and here we have our “Webcast - Groups 2”.You see that the page has adapted to your request and we will see that, now I have subscribed to this group, I see on the middle the list of all conversations and on the right, the content of the selected conversation.It will open on the right. Each time you create a group, we have this welcome message that says with the group you can start a conversation, view group files and activity, use the calendar, connect your apps, etc.On the left, all the conversations dedicated to the group, sent by the group or to the group. In the ribbon Home, be careful it’s a new window that is open and in this window there is only one tab called Home,you will be able to start a new conversation, a bubble group and the recipient of the email will be the “Webcast – Groups 2”, so it means all the group and all members of the group. You can add new items: E-mail Message,appointment, meeting. It means that somehow, the Groups are managing the calendar and you find it in the ribbon.Membership: You will unsubscribe. Add Members: You can add members to this group of personsdirectly from there once the group is created. You can Edit Group: Change the name, add a description, add people, change the language for the group.If you want people to send emails to the group, don't forget to take check this box so that people can access your group. We have a button called Calendar.It is strictly and completely dedicated to this group, so if you create new appointment, it will be directly sent to the group.All members of the group will receive this appointment and you have the possibility to use all the features of Outlook like the Scheduling Assistant, the possibility to have a recurrence, to categorized, insert an attachment file.All the features of Outlook are available, you can even have a Skype meeting with this calendar.In terms of view, you can ask for the day, the work week, schedule, etc. So it means that the calendar is totally and completely available for all members of the group.It’s a way to share one group without having to specify each time who is a member or which audience will be contacted. It's just opening this calendar, will send an invitation to all the members of the group.From the calendar you can also create another group. In case you want to subscribe to group of Groups to see and have Groups.In Outlook you see Calendar and you can also see Files. Each group createdfrom Outlook has a sharing space dedicated to documents where you will be able to upload files or folders exactly as you would with your personal OneDrive oryour business OneDrive in your organization. You see that you can upload a document and, as all members have access to this space, they are now able see the document.You have a mail messaging service, you've got a calendar dedicated to the group and you've got a shared space to upload documents, meaning that these documents are available anywhereand from any device, you just need an Internet connection. So that's the opportunity to go on the space dedicated to the group.Always available with Outlook whatever the version you use. If you go to the account of your organization, you have all the groups that you are a member of.Files, a dedicated space, notebook. There is also a notebook online that the group will share together. It's based on OneNote online and you have the possibility to create a section nameand a page to share information.You can use all the features of OneNote, to insert a picture, pictures online, a file printout, a link, whatever.It means that you’ve got all the same features that you have with Outlook or with Office 365 on a common way, you can use it but dedicated to the group. This way, the group is sharing a conversation, emails with the inside or the outside.You have a file system to share, documents, OneDrive, dedicated to the group. It's in SharePoint but it’sthe same way of working as on OneDrive, so you can get a link, share, etc. And you have a notebook that you can share with the group.There is a version on the web. Here we are or coming from our desktop Outlook 2016, so we have been automatically connected to the online version.But if you need to access the group from the outside of Office, remotely, from any computer or any device,you only need an Internet connection and you just need to enter in the address bar of any browser “portal.office.com” and you will be connected to this pagewith the welcome message and you will have, from the start menu online, the possibility to select the options.You will be arriving once connected with all the applications available for you and by your company. If you click on Mail on the left, you get Outlook.You see the groups and have access to the Groups in the same manner as with Outlook 2016. You have the list of conversations and have access to the calendar.In the groups that you want to see, we will see different groups.And here is the Webcast – Groups 2. That's the content of your group, here is the list, on the left, of all Groups. If you select, they are added and you can place them. You see that there are different colors. So webcast group is available and you can even create a calendar event,an email message.From online, from anywhere in the world, at any time, you can access your calendar.Office 365 will bring you to the welcome page. But there is also the application launcher. You can go to SharePoint, OneDrive. If you select Mail,from Outlook, select Groups and you can access the files or notebook.Even Planner.In Files,you will see the files that I have uploaded. Notebook, the notes that I have created a few minutes ago and here you have even a planning tool, which is called Planner.Where you can very easilycreate a task and assign a task to someone in the group. So you have All plans, you see Webcast -Groups 2. Let's go.So that's Webcast – Groups 2 and you see Add task, so you can add a task with a task name. You can select To do,and set a due date, next week for example.When you add a task for the plans.And you can select a bucket, which kind of task it is, it is not started, so that you can follow. The start date, today, it could be in tomorrow. The due date, let’s say it’s the 13th. Add an item if we need to add something to mark complete.The description of the task.Attach a file if you need and write a message and post it.Add assignment, so you assign a task to someone.To Amarra Mazouni, we have the task which will be marked complete by Amarra when she is finished. Here you have the Board.The Charts.It shows you the progress, here we have one task left, who is in charge. On the right you can group by or no grouping all the tasks. So you can see the tasks that are not started, in progress, completed.You can go back to mark if a task is complete. If we go to the Charts, there is no task left.On the right we see that the task has been completed. So it's very easy for you in a group to get Planner which is created instantly as soon as the group is created.The plan is created along. You can create new tasks and assign tasks to members of the group.So that's how you can easily access your group features from anywhere. When you're on Planner, if you go to the application launcher, you can go back to the Mail, Calendar and get more applications that you may find and in discover in another MOOC training, for example, Yammer, which is a perfect complement to a group.So that's what I could show you regarding the Groups. I've shown you all the features and how to be more efficient with Groups in terms of communication with features which are available from Outlook or Outlook online if you want to communicatewith a group of people. Thank you for attending this session. Hope you make the best use of it and bye bye.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],1618.0,webcast
1946,en,Outlook 2016 - Optimize your organization,13.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. The main topic of these trainings is to get started with Office and more specifically, today we're going to see how to optimize your organization in Microsoft Outlook.Welcome to this session my name is Charles Bonachera and we are going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. What are we going to discuss during this time period? Here is the plan of the session. We will see how to organize first the view,what you see in your emailbox, the layout and what you prefer to see first or enhanced or highlighted in your emailbox. Then we will see the folders, how to create a folder and how to move a email to a specific folder.Then we will have a closer look to the categories and how they are activated in Outlook, how you can assign a major category and how you can change or create categories. At the end, we will see how you can have a follow-upon emails, to decide, to manage, to handle it, to treat it later on in the same day, the next day or the next week. The objectives of this session are mainly to discover how Outlook 2016can help you to keep your emailbox cleanly organized. Let's go to Outlook.Here is Outlook and that’s the view that you will be get on the first access to the Outlook application.That's exactly the standard view.In the upper part, the tabs that give you access to a lot of commands that are grouped in the ribbon, the ribbon being this part with many icons giving access to commands.If you change the tab, the ribbon changes and adapts to what you are supposed to need for the action in this tab. Here for example, in the Folder tab, I have the main commands that I need tohave an action on folders. Back to the Home tab. That's where you will get the first time that you connect to Outlook. So we've seen the tabs, the ribbon. On the left we see the Folder Panewith all the folders related to your account. Here there are many accounts but let's say that you get only one account. In the middle, the list of incoming emails filtered by the newest on top andthe oldest at the bottom. On the right, the Reading Panewhere you can see the content of an email once you have selected it.The first thing that you can organize is your view.By default, you'll get this one, but you can change it very easily by going to the View tab and there you'll get access to the main actions related to the view. For example here in the layout group,you will get a button regarding the Folder Pane. We will see that the Folder Pane is supposed to be normal and we'll have favorites displayed on the Folder Pane. If you want to have it minimized, just select Minimized. We can even turn it offso you don't have any access to your folders, and you can put it back.In terms of Reading Pane, it is by default on the right but you can request it to be at the bottomor you can turn it off. If you open an email and there is no Reading Pane, you will need to open with a double-click and at new pop up window will appear with the content of the email.The To-Do Bar is related to the other modules of Outlook. The first one is the Calendar that will open on the right of the screen.With all the meetings, appointments or events in your Calendar for the next 7 days. You can close it with the cross or on the bar you can activate or deactivate the calendar.Next, you open search fields to search for people, for example.I can look for Amarra and I find my colleague.Lastly, you can open the tasks. On the right you will get the list of all that you have to do for different dates. Here we have no dates defined for emails and in this case, you have all emails with no date.Here is what you have to treat, to manage today.And if you double-click, you open the related email and the following week. So I will show you how to assign a follow-up of an email in a few minutes.I will get back to the standard view, Reading Pane on the right.And my list in the middle.If you look at the list, you'll see that there is not only one email. But if you go up in the Message Preview you see that it is off. But you can ask for 1, 2 or 3 lines. If you ask for 3 lines in this folder, you see thateach email with a preview with the 3 first lines of the email itself. You can turn it off for this folder, you see that it could be done for all the inboxes in caseyou have lots of inboxes. The list will show differently depending on the size that you assigned to the list.If you resize it, you see that the layout changes and you have all the columns available instead of just a few ones: All, Unread, Mentions, the order is by date and a second order, the newest on top.If you  increase the size of the list, you get columnswith all the available information. I'll get back to normal and show you how to change the layout. Here it is ordered by date; If you click on this little arrow,you’ll get a menu where you can select a new order. For example, you can ask forthe sender. You can see that the list has changed and is organized by sender. Here I have all the emails sent by Pierre, another sender, and another one.To have things more defined, you can select an order. You cannot ask to show the emails the groups and now you've got groups created for each sender.And if you wish you are stillnot completely satisfied with this solution, you can right-click on the header and you see that you can collapse emails and in this case,all the emails from the sender appear and you can have many emails in one group. You can see that all the groups where emails are unread appear in boldwith a number of emails which are still to be treated. If you click on Unread, you get the same grouping by senders but in this case, only the unless groups will appear in bold,with the number of unread emails. Many layouts are available for you to change your preferences the view of emails.If I click on Date and uncheck Show in Groups, I have it organized by date with the newest on top and the oldest at the bottom. That’s the first thing that you can do with the View. One last perhaps: By default, emails arrivewith the oldest at the bottom and the newest on top, but you can ask to show them as conversations. If you click on Show as Conversations, each time there has been a conversationbetween you and a sender or you and a recipient, emails are grouped so that the same subject will lead to the group conversation, meaning that this conversation was originatedwith the response and a counter response, etc. When the subject does not change, it is considered the same conversation and you can group the group as a conversation.If you uncheck this box, the email list gets back to normal and you have the same standard view as at the beginning. This is what you can do regarding the view of your emails and the organization under View. Everything is under the View tab to organize it as you prefer.The other thing that you can do is create folders. In your account, in your mailbox, you can right-click and ask for a new folder.Give it a name.The folder come in alphabetical order. It appears at the bottom because of the W but first it appears underneath the name of the account. Once you've pressed the key enter on the keyboard,it goes directly in the list in the alphabetical order.The folder has been created, it's empty, and if you want to move an email to this folder, you have to right-click (in Outlook and in all of Office 365, the right-click gives you access to lots of actions relate to the context menu).It changes, if you right-click in the Folder Pane, the menu is not the same as on the email. So, if you want to move an email to the Webcast folder that I have just created, right-click on an email and Move and you see thatyou have all the folders of all your inboxes in the whole Outlook. Then you can decide where to send your email. If I click on Webcast, I've got my email here, which has been moved manually to the place I wanted,the folder I have just created. You can also drag and drop.If I open it, I have 2 emails: One that I've moved with right-click and the other one that I've moved with a drag and drop.You can select and move back to another folder or to the inbox.Now you have your emails. You see that you can just delete a folder once you have used it.In terms of organization,you can have a category assigned to an email. Right-click and in the middle of the menu you'll find Categorize. By default, the category are color category. The blue category is a standard category.There is a red category, purple, yellow, but each category can be changed in terms of name. If you click on All Categories, you see the available categories and you can rename each category. For example, in terms of projects.Now you see that my email in the list appears in red.In the Reading Pane, you can see that just above the content of the email the red bar appears with the name of the category.Interesting to see that you can apply different categories to an email. There is a drop-down menu to select a category.If you increase, you see the categories.If your layout is this, the order is no longer available directly so you should right-click on a colum, Arrange by and you get the same menu I showed you before.So you can also organize by categories here.If you arrange it in groups, you can right-click and collapse all groups and now you have all your categories. This is another way to organize the view in terms of organization. All your emails are organized regarding the category.All blue categories are here.Right-click on a column header, Date and Show in Groups. Then you can close or resize.The last thing that we can dois to organize a little bit your inbox. You can assign a follow-up to an email. Right-click and after Categorize you find Follow Up. You can assign a follow-up today, tomorrow, this week or next week.If you click on This week, there's a new flag that appears in the email.If you increase there is a specific column for that. And if you ask the To-Do bar and Tasks, at the right Next Week, get the report completed, you get the email in the list available for you to have an action on this emailand perform what was requested from you on this email.This way, you haveall the tasks they once completed. Click on the flag and the task appears as complete. It's a way to see exactly that this email needed at a certain point to be followed up, and now the action is completed.and it's closed, that no action is required now.You can close the taskbar to get back to normal. This was an overview of the few things that you can perform quickly to organize your inbox. Other things are available, a little more advanced.To go further, you have the MOOC training to find other MOOC trainings. Thank you for attending this session, and I hope you will make the best use of this. Thank you very much. Bye.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],1253.0,webcast

The interesting things with cloud computing with Office 365 is that, along with the applicationinstalled on your computer, there are nowOffice web applications which are available and are setup to be able to fit the exact screen, for example, of a tablet. So you have web applications available, which are also Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.On your smartphone, there are also Office mobile applications, Outlook for example, but also Word. All the Office suite is available on your mobile, be it your Android mobileor an iPhone from Apple. With Office 365 online, you have complete access whenever you want, wherever you are because it's available only with an Internet connection with any device.It's very powerful and helpful to have these applications available 24/7 wherever you are. You only need a device and an Internet connection. The compatibility is complete with the Office desktop applicationsbecause Office 365 is built by the same company Microsoft builts its desktop so there is total compatibility between the application that you access or that you may access online or on your computer.Security: It is secured. You need a connection to be connected to Office 365 online. Serenity because you can work if needed, when needed, anywhere and at any time.Let's see how to connect to the web from anywhere.You only need to enter in the address bar of any browser, Internet Explorer or Microsoft edge if you work with Windows 10, portal.office.com.You will be connected to this space which is the welcome page of Office 365, with all your applications that are available in the Office 365 suite: Mail, Calendar and all the rest of the applications that I've mentioned already Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.Wherever you are you can always go and find the another applications with the application launcher, which is kind of a start menu online that will give you access to all that list that we have seen previously.Groups and Planner.So let's go online. Let's go to the welcome page.You are welcome in Office 365, you are connected to your organization using your email address and your Office passwordthat you use by default and standard on your computer at your organization. So you have all applications and we are here to discover Planner and you see that here is the tile to access Planner.Even if you are on another application for example, in the mail, you still have access to the launcher. And here again, you find Planner.Let's go to Planner: Here is the interface of Planner. We see here it's Planner. Here in the Planner hub,that's where you get all your plans. By plan, we mean all the planningsthat you may have, the dedicated groups. Here you see your tasks. I have 4 tasks and if I click here I see all my tasks that might come from different plans.This is a group: Webcast, migration. This is Essencia Formation SNCF, etc. So I can see all my tasks, even the completed one.In progress, not started yet or completed. When you arrive on the Planner homepage, you get access to the Planner hub with all your plants and I click on a plan to enter into the plan of migration.For example, you can put your plans in favorite, but you have the list of all plans. So there is a double navigation on the left pane and here on the homepage of Planner. You've got the list of all your groups.Then you have the button to create a new plan. When you have a project or something you have to share with a group or a team and you want to follow the tasks that are delegated or assigned to members of the group,what is important to understand is that each time you create a new plan, like I'm going to do now, a group is created. There is a specific MOOC training on groups that you can also follow,explaining how you can be more efficient with groups. Each time you create a plan, you have to create a group, so it's impossible to have a plan without a group. When you go to your Outlook and create a group,either you use Planner or not, but you can have a group without using Planner, but it is impossible to have a plan, to use Planner without a group. So if I request a new plan and give a name to my plan,Webcast - Planner for example, the plan email address would be webcast-planner@yourorganization. You can decide whether the group is public or not.Public means anybody will be able to see what's inside the group. Otherwise people will have to request access to your group and you have to be part of the group to see the information and give a description of the group/plan.I've requested a plan so we have a group and I will be able to follow up. If I click on Create Plan, there will be a new plan, which is in fact a plan and a group. I again propose you to follow the MOOC Office 365 training on groups to see how it works.We are going to see a few things about the way Office 365 proposes you to share information with emails, conversations, calendar, notebook for each group, calendar and files.I am on Webcast Planner. This is my plan. I am still in Planner, so this is my plan. But if you go here and click on the 3 dots, you see that you will go to the calendar of this group.You will see the members of the group, you can see the files members shared and the notebook which is also created when you ask and request a new plan. So here we are in the part of Plannerdedicated to the Webcast - Planner group and we are going to see how we can use this application to follow the tasks of a group. The board is where you will be able to create tasks.The Charts is a view of the follow up of all the tasks. So no tasks left, unassigned, no tasks have been created. If you want to create a task you go to BoardYou have the possibility to create a new task. So to give a task,call the client for example, it is a to-do task for the moment and you can add a due date.For example, the 1st of March. If you add a task, here it is now.If you click on this task, you will be able to assign tasks to someone.I have found a name which is not member.So I have assigned the task to my colleague. The bucket is a to do task. It is not started yet. The start date will be tomorrow and the due date, March, 2nd.I can check this if I want to mark it complete now, which would be quite stupid.The description of the task:The client has to be called.You can even attach a file, browse SharePoint to find a file online, from a SharePoint in the SharePoint of your company for example, or upload a file from your own computer.It takes a few seconds for the file to be attached and uploaded. You can add comments.Please, Amarra, call the client.And if you post,it is posted and if you quitthere is now a new task that has just been assigned to Amarra and we will be informed if she has a new task. I could have gone directly in Members.I could have added Amarra before all of this by opening Outlook because people get the request in Outlook. I told you about another training on Groupsbut it's on Outlook 2016 that you can create groups or from here. I am on Outlook online and I click on Add members. Here you have people from the same company who come with nothing, and guests are people from outside with this symbol, meaning it's someoneoutside your organization.So now she's a member of my group and I remind you that my group is because I have requested this Planner and by pre-requesting and creating a Planner, there is a group created and now there is a group that can share conversations, calendar, files, a notebook.I go back to Planner to have a follow-up of my tasks. So it's very easy when you connect your to Office 365.Get to Planner and select users listand guests will be able to follow all the tasks, create new tasks: Get technical data.I add a task and I can assign it to my colleagues.  I can even set a label ""Project"".I can instantly know to which project the task is related for example, or any other category that you would attribute to this task.So now I have a new task and if I go to charts, I will be able to seethat there are two tasks left that you can group here: No grouping or Assigned to. In this case, I have all the tasks assigned to me and to my colleague. If I go to the tasks, I will be able to mark the task as completed and it disappeared. If I go to Charts, there is only one task left assigned to Amarra.I can see the completed task, which appears here.If I go to my inbox in Outlook, I've joined the webcast and here I have called the client.I can see my tasks. I received emails and I can go to Planner to follow my tasks or my colleague's.Here is how you can instantly create a plan. With this plan comes a group, which is mandatory. You can have a group with no plans defined, but you cannot have a plan without a group, so each time you create a plan, you have a group and again, you will be ableto share conversations, calendar, members, files, notebook and I propose you to follow the MOOC training about groups.Here is what I could say about Planner.So thanks for attending this session, hope you can can make the best use of it.

1948,en,PowerPoint - Save time with themes and templates,11.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a big topic called “Get started with Office”. The subject of this session is to discover how to save time with the themes and templates provided by Microsoft PowerPoint.Welcome to this session. My name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next 30 to 45 minutes together. Let's look at the agenda, the plan of this session.We will see the difference of creating a presentation from scratch versus using a template. Then we will see that you can change the template once you have chosen one.We will also see how we can use different themes that are provided by Microsoft PowerPoint once you have started your presentation creation process. We will see that you can modify a theme and at the end of course will see how to save a theme before you save the whole presentation.The goal of this session is to help you save time in the creation process and at the same time try to increase the efficiency of your presentations. So, let's start and we start with PowerPoint.If you start from scratch the first time you open PowerPoint,you arrive on this page where you can understand easily that you have at your disposal different templates with different names.And these are templates that you can use to create your own presentation. But if you prefer you can directly go to the blank presentation to start from scratch. Your presentations are different and here for example,the pages are white, blank. Understand that we can teach you how to add a title so let's create a title, a simple one.Below it, click to add subtitle.It’s easy to understand, this slide is based on a standard template even if it's a plan. If we go to View and ask to see the slide master, will see that this is the master title.If we close, we can see that is the title slide. But you can see nothing is formatted.Just put a title, a subtitle and that's all. Now you ask for a new slide, either in the ribbon or with the right click in the navigation pane to add a new slide which is based on this slide,with the title and content and you see that they are different. But they are still blank pages. You can add a title and text.You have to do everything on your own.It means that in another slide you can ask for a new slide. You can change the layout, for example, with just title and see that there is nothing but the title. This is a totally and completely blank presentation.You nevertheless can insert pictures for example.Then if you look at the right you see that there are already a kind of theme or template because here it's a new thing in PowerPoint 2016to help you in the design of slides. When you insert a picture, you can choose the layout for this page. So here for example, this is the design, we can change it and adapt it to your own preferences and needs.So that's the first possibility, the first glance of what would be a template.What is available to you is you can add Quick Styles. These are not themes or templates but you can see that you can instantly change the style of shape.And you can adapt, but it is very simple and you still have to change the colors on your own.But it's really a complete creation from scratch. The interesting thing is that you can do whatever you like and whatever you fancy and what you prefer to do, but in terms of quickness in terms of efficiency the result will be what it will be.Another way is to select in the Design, we can see that there is already the possibility to change the template.It keeps what you have already created.But it adapts to the templates that are existing.That’s the first possibility to use a template, lots of templates are available. Now, if you prefer to directly start with a template, you may choose from the template.Why not for example, we start with this one and you see that there are variants in terms of color,in terms of background, different things but still keeping the same template so if you decide to create from this template, you can use a quicker aspect theme.But if you start to create, everything is adapted to the layout. Here you see that there is a title.Everything is created so if you want to ask for a new slide, the template is kept so everything is adapted and you can still select a picture.The system will propose you design ideas based on the same template. You see it has adapted the colors and the background. Even the font has changed.This is the first possibility. Here, you can select the layout.There are other opportunities. If you want, for example, to insert a chart.It will automatically adapt, but if you look at the ribbon you see that the chart can be changed.From there, you can instantly start changing the style of the chart and that's the real good thing.This is the part of the chart’s title, but if we go back to our title slide, if we go to Design, we can find the templates and you can change the template and have an instant overview of the result.Even for the other page.It’s instantly changing so you can instantly decide whether you want to change the template or not. But even so, if you select a template,you can at any time change the template and you see the variants are available here. Another thing: If you work for a new slide it will take the same template and you see that the background has changed.If you insert a chart, you can change the colors of the template. But depending on what you want to do with the presentation, if the purpose is to give information,to give ideas, to promote ideas, strategies, to make a message go through a presentation, you have the possibility to select SmartArt Graphics, which will help you in the creation of your slides.They're all grouped. If you want to have a list of possibilities…If I select these parts and go to the home to convert to SmartArt, I can change directly and have a new theme.Or a new SmartArt. So, first possibility: You can adapt the SmartArts. If you want more SmartArts, if you want to describe the process, you would perhaps add a SmartArt graphic or a cycle, you can change it.Hierarchy, relationship, etc. So, you can directly use it without having to create it, of course you could do that on your own, but it would take pretty much more time and with a result which would perhaps be better.Anyway, in terms of times it would be much more different. So here for example, interesting if you select this one, you can open here, and you can enter a new one.So very interesting to try to use already created SmartArts. In terms of design,we have seen that the design has changed. You can change the design; you see that your SmartArt instantly adapted to the situation.With Quick Styles you can change in terms of colors, but if you select your SmartArt, you can change the Quick Style, the theme style. It's very one by one. But if you go to the Design, in the SmartArt, you can change style and see the result of changing the layout.So, you will have to adapt to what you need but you see that if you keep the SmartArts, you can change not only the colors but the background of each form.You see everything is changing. So easily you can get your own needs and preferences.The same here, it converts to SmartArts directly.It’s really interesting to use this kind of thing. Once you have got the design, you can change the complete colors using the theme basic colors that are present in the themes,but you also have different options, so it's very in a few clicks to select but first should again fit your needs, your preferences, colors, themes and templates that will highlight and give more power to your ideas and the content of your slides.Exactly as it did here for the design, you can change instantly and give something totally different.Each time it is very easy and interesting to use design to change the font of the theme. It is very powerful.And you can if you want in a few clicks, whatever you do, you have the same template and you can reuse it all the time. So, it's very easy to change the text field, effects using the SmartArt tools in terms of design, template format, shape fill, shape outline, text field, text outline. Everything can be changed now that you have selected a theme or a template.In a few clicks you can change and completely adapt the content of your presentation. If you have for example, selected something which fits your needs in terms of the organization, your objectives orif you want to reuse this template for the next presentation to keep the same layout, the same colors or forms or format shapes, etc.,you can go in the Design tab in the Themes group. If you select, you get all the list of presentations with Custom presentation, the Office which are provided by default by the system. You can save the current theme. I've already saved other themes.You’ll see the themes I've been updated and now if you open it, you see that in my Custom you have different themes and templates that you can.These are the ones I used before. It means that you can have your own templates, select one orcreate your own template from scratch, which is still possible. I think this is a very good opportunity to save a lot of time and get a more powerful presentation.You can have your ideas better presented and better understood by your audienceand people that will see this presentation.These are the possibilities, now you just have to save your presentation.Either online using the different features and spaces available online with Office 365 or on your. Once you have saved you will see that you can reuse this theme as many times as you want in the Custom part.The first ones, this one is organic but this one is a true theme that I saved. This one, the second, the third and the last one that we did together.In the last arrow we have got everything, Custom and standard, the very first templates and themes will be your own ones.This is the end.I can close that.Here is my current presentation.Thanks for attending, make the best use of it and bye bye.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],1338.0,webcast
1950,en,OneNote 2016 - Discover the notes tool,14.0,"Welcome to this Office 365 training. This session is part of a bigger topic called: “Get started with Office”. The goal of this session is to discover Microsoft's note-taking tool, which is called OneNote which you may already know.Welcome to this session, my name is Charles Bonachera and we're going to spend the next roughly 30 minutes together. What will we be discussing during this period? We will see how to change and organize notes with this application, we will see how to share notes with someone else from your own organizationor even outside if you take advantage of the other applications of the Office 365 suite. And then at the end, we will have a lo at the online version of OneNote,which is  one of the Office 365 online applications. The objectives of this session are mainly to discover the way to create, centralize and share all your notes. Then to discover the advantages of OneNote and how to use it effectively.So let’s go to OneNote.I will open it now.If it’s the very first time that you open OneNote, you may arrive to something called Quick Notes. Here it is in French but the rest of the interface is in English, probably because I've changed languages many, Spanish, French, English.What you may very well understand is that these Quick Notes, on the very first time you connect to OneNote,  explains the relationship that you can find between OneNote on a computer and a paper notebo that you may have already written.So it explains how OneNote can be used at work at the office, at home  to plan a camping trip, to buy any device, or at school.To take notes during courses, etc. So OneNote can be used anywhere, and the purpose of OneNote is to take notes as its name suggests.That means that it is not comparable to Word which is really an application designed to build text, even bos, formatted text, long text. It is not the purpose of OneNote. It is very good at taking quick notespretty much as you could do on a piece of paper as I've done a few time ago and I've got one on my  desktop here. So it is comparable to a piece of paper but pretty much more user-friendlybecause you can use it when you work with another application. We could  take notes in a few instant because there would be an icon to switch to OneNote and take a quick note. So at the very startyou connect to Quick Notes. You will find it in English to explain what you can do with that and even at the end there is a small video that you can take. It’s one minute, really short and you can take it and view it to find how it works.Then you can take advantage of this note-taking tool. We are on the interface. It is very easy if you are familiar with Office 365 or Outlo 2016. You may recognize the tabs which gives you access to lots of commands.Depending on the tabs know that the ribbon always changes to provide you with the best commands related to the topic you’re in, for example, you have all the commands to insert itemsin your page, in your notebo. If you want to use the drawing tool of OneNote, the ribbon changes and provides you with all the tools related to drawing, etc.If you are familiar with it, you will probably not be very much estranged by this ribbon. On the left part of the screen is the navigation pane where you will navigate between notebos because you may have different notebos.In the middle, you can access the notebo itselfwith a blank page if you are not in the Quick Notes that were part of the initiating page. At the far right, you find buttons saying “Add Page”, meaning that here you will find all the pages. If we lo at the Quick Notes which is kind of aLet's start from the beginning. The first time you arrive there, once you've discovered Quick Notes explaining how to work with OneNote, you may want to create a notebo. For that, right-click on the navigation pane. There is “New Notebo…” and this is the first possibilityprovided to you by OneNote, which is to create your notebo. You can create it online in the Cloud by using the OneDrive, may it be personal or organizational, professional.This one is professional; this one is my personal. Or in a SharePoint also related to a company in a SharePoint site. You may decide to create this notebo online totake advantage of your online features, that is that you can connect to his notebo from anywhere in the world, with any device, be it a smartphone, a tablet or a PC. There are other web locations which arerelated to Office 365 online but you can  decide to create it on this. You  give a name to the notebo and you click on Create Notebo.Here is your first notebo with the first section. You give a name to the section.Now you are ready to take notes. You can double click to change the name of the section, the first chapter if we compare to a bo for example, which is something more complex than  a piece of paper.Here is my first page. Now, what is very clear and very easy to do is that wherever you click in this pane,the system will instantly take a note.If I click here in the middle, this is another one.So it's very easy to take a note. If you click  in the same place, this will be added to your first note.That's the first possibility, wherever you write, the system understands, and it takes a note. There is no necessity to format or to have anything in mind prepared, you  take a note, that’s exactly the function ofthis application: Taking quick notes wherever you are, during a meeting. This is the first thing. There are formatting possibilities. If you select what you have  written, you can put it in bold, you can increase the font, decide what font, you can change the color of the letters,you can change the background, you can do many things and you can even format painter to apply the same formatting to this other part of the document, to these notes.So when you select something, you can change it. Afterwards, you can can format the notes that you have taken, and you can move things everywhere.You can give a style to this note. First, you can write anything anywhere. Here we have a notebook in the navigation pane.Here we have a section, this is a page. On the far right this is the page and we can add another page. It is untitled but here we can give it a name.So it is very easy and we can switch between pages easily. If we need another, right click in the navigation pane. We can create a new section.We are in Section 2, there is no page so we can give another page another name.each time that you take a note, you can, with a right-click, access to many things. That's usual with Office 365 or the Office suite on your desktop 2016.The right-click is very important, for example, you can change the name and it proposes you something when it does not recognize what's been written down. Here there is something interesting, formatting, but also something called “Tag” and with it you can instantlygive a tag to what you write down and say that is important. You can even highlightand use many other Tags to these Quick Notes that you have taken. If it is critical, you can highlight it different ways, move it, right-click, give a Tag, etc. Discuss with a person, give a namecall back… Anything that you can do with these quick notes that you have taken. If we look at the ribbon, there is a To Do Tag and you can in a quick instant add a To Do Tag so have different tasks.Once it is done, you click to show this has been done. It’s a very easy way to create quick notes but you have much more than only Quick Notes written or somewhere on your monitor, or somewhere on your own physical desktop.So it's between a piece of paper and Word which is something to create nearly books or at least long texts formatted with many other functions. Here it is the same as with the right-click. What is also very interesting is thatin these notes you can insert many things: Tables, and you decide which kind of table it is and you have a table.You just have to fill in. You can insert and once you have created the table,you have the layout you can change.Insert file attachments, attach a file that we open quickly, attach a file, insert a chart or table, insert a spreadsheet.So let's attach a file. If you double click, you open the document, which is here.Sheet 1 and sheet 2. So it’s a very easy way to insert. You can insert pictures.Then you can resize the picture.You can insert online pictures that you may find on the web, using for example Bing, if you want to have some something.You can also insert videos and you can record audio and video; It will be added to this part of the notebook. If you select the Screen Clipping, you can directly copy a screenshot of your screen.With Screen Clipping, you have the name, time and date.You can also insert a Date and Time. It's interesting, you can make many different things with Insert. You can draw with a few objects. For example, you can underline everything, erase with a Small Eraser, Medium Eraser, you can change the color of your highlighter.You can insert objects, shapes and you can insert Page Templates. For example, Formal Meeting Notes. There is a template to take notes, so it means that now instantly you can havea template that you can use for a meeting where you can have an agenda, the attendees, you can insertdate and time, attendees and you can write “Were present”.Instantly you can have these templates.If you select the page template on the far right, you'll get all the page templates. A lot are available because I've used 3 languages. But they are all the same, detailed notes,see the course… There are many templates that you may reuse directly in this OneNote.History: Once you have been creating new notebooks and you start working with it with different days, if you are different authors for this, if you click here on the tab,you see Recent Edits and you can find all the edits today. On the far right, there is a new pane open and that will show me all that has been modified.You can search the notebook, search sections, etc. If you want to find who has been creating something.Quickly take notes between the piece of paper Microsoft Office Word. At the end, once you have finished creating you notebook,  if you go to Filesit's instantly synchronized.If you want to share it, if it has not been synchronized, if it's not on OneDrive, you will select Move Notebook to OneDrive if you have been creating it on your computer.Your notebook is now syncing to the new location, now a new field is opening, and you can share it with someone in your organization or someone else.Even the people with whom you are sharing this document will be able to edit or view the content of the document. I suggest that you require users to sign in before accessing the documentto improve the security of this document in case you have something sensitive, something that you don't want to share with everybody. This document will be shared with people so we can click here.Remove people. It is shared instantly and you can get a sharing link if you don't want to share it with someone inside the organization by getting sharing a link,you can create a view link and an edit link. If you create a link, you will be able to copy it and paste it in a message in Outlook and send it to somebody that will receive this link and by clicking this link, if it's an edit link,they will be able to edit the document. If you select Create a view link, they will only be able to view the link. Anyone with an edit link can edit.If you are in a meeting for example, a Skype for business meeting, which is also included in the Office 365, you can instantly Share with Meeting. You will instantly share this notebook in the meeting with all the audience, all the participants.There are many possibilities to create quick note and to share it afterwards.One thing regarding the online version: OneNote online is part of the Office 365 version, to connect to the Office 365 account online, you need to enter “portal.office.com” on any web browser address bar.Once connected, you will get the list of all your applications online and you will find OneNote and it is the same as the desktop version.You see the list of all your notebooks, wherever you are you can consult your notebooks.OneNote Online has exactly the same tabs:The ribbon and the commands related to the tabs, the notebook, the sections. You can create a new section, can create a new page. You can change, format text, insert but you have less possibilities than on the desktop.But you can insert sections and pictures online, you can change the view, you can show authors, you have a reading view, etc. Once you have created, you can create notebooks online.There is an alert because something coming from the Web is trying toopen the computer. There is a connection between the online notebook and OneNote on your desktop.From the app launcher, you can access directly wherever you are, and you can open a notebook.So here is what we could say about OneNote, on computer and online.Thanks for attending and try to make good use of it.

It will possibly go to sleep mode,10so make sure you keep it active, particularly on laptop devices.11Let's have a look at what we're covering.12In this session, we will look at managing your contacts using contact groups in Skype for Business.13Enriching your Skype meetings additional collaborative tools,14additional content.15Configuring your interface and various Skype for business settings in your options.16We’ll look at managing automatic status updates, replies17and configure audio and video equipment to use Skype for Business.18Lastly we’ll have a look at using PBX exchange type desk phone with Skype Business as well.19At this point we're assuming you're generally happy with the basic purpose and use of Skype for Business in terms of its concepts, instant messaging chat and voice/video calls, etc.20and we're concentrating more on configuring our Skype for Business environment and settings and enriching our communication.21So the objective of the session is to discover Skype for Business and be happy, configuring various settings and options in Skype for Business.22It's not really a training session, it's more a presentation about the use and configuration possibilities of Skype for Business.23Let's get started.24If you have added contacts to your Skype contact list, it's easy to manage and organize them.25You can easily find, sort, rename, remove contacts if you need to.26You can organize them by using contact groups.27Groups are essentially collections of contacts.28You can can create and see several contacts displayed in their own sections29and you can communicate with all members at the same time.30For example, you can instant message chat with them,31start a video call,32send email or schedule a meeting with all those people in that group in one click33rather than individually select multiple contacts from the list.34You decide what groups you want and who should belong to each group.35For example, you might create a group for you and  your colleagues working on the same projects,36you might set up a second group for people you're working with on another project,37and maybe a third one containing family and friends and so on.38You can delete groups as easily as you create them.39If you add a contact to your contacts list,40not to group but just to your contacts list,41and decide not to assign them to a group as you add them42Skype automatically adds them to a catchall group called ""other contacts"",43which has got the same access level as a colleague which we will see in a moment.44That's a little look at the environment.45On the screen, you can see how to create a new group.46You can click the icon with 2 people with a plus sign47and choose ""Create a New Group"".48Or you can right-click on existing groups in the groups list49and choose ""Create New Group"".50Let's open Skype for Business.51We can see our groups over here.52There are tabs for groups, status, relationships and new.53Let's have a look at groups.54These are subtabs55and they different ways of viewing your contacts.56This way, you view them by groups,57This way you see your contacts by the status: online, offline, away, etc.58and this one by relationships to you as a contact. We will look at it in a moment.59The New tab shows you if any people have added you as a contact recently.60They'll show up in the list. You can right-click and add them to your contacts list and particular groups if you want to.61We're concentrating on groups.62We've got people in our favorite list63and other contacts.64You can collapse the groups with the little arrows if you want to hide the group65or expand it, you can do that as well.66By clicking on the arrow, you can collapse and expand the group.67You can click this group and see that members of that group called Team will appear.68I can move people from group to group.69I can add contacts to a group and so on.70If I right-click Fabrice, I get options to copy the contact.71I can copy it to another group72called web contacts,73or I can choose to move him to web contacts.74It means that when I choose ""Move"" they're going to be moved from the team to web contacts75and if I choose ""Copy"" they're going to be in both groups.76They are management groups and it makes it easier to communicate with them on mass.77If I choose ""Copy To"" web contacts for example,78and we expand, we see that Fabrice is now in there. Let's do that with another one, like Guillaume.79Right-click on Guillaume and choose “Copy to”80web contacts and he is also in there.81These people are in multiple groups.82If I choose to remove them from the group,83right-click and choose ""Remove from Group"".84They still exist in the other group,85it's not a security membership group but a grouping in Skype for Business for communication purposes.86You can also drag and drop people from group to group.87Drag someone and release them.88I can move Guillaume from that group to the other group or right-click or drag and drop.89Contacts come along to multiple groups.90To communicate with a group91right-click on a name.92Rather than having to individually select each of these 3 people in this list of contacts or in the team93I can right-click and choose things like “send an IM”94to start a chat with those people, a conference/Skype call,95video call, send an email message or schedule a meeting.96If I choose “Send an IM” for example,97(I will bring that window from my other screen)98all the participants are in: myself and those 3 people in web contacts group are in this list.99If I click on the participants pane it will open the full pane to show the users.100It's a very quick way of having an IM chat with 3 other people at the same time, rather than having to individually select them and add them to the conversation.101We can do that.102We can also do things like start a call,103send an email, schedule a meeting with these groups on mass that way.104It's very easy to create a new group.105We saw before that you have this little button.106It says ""Add a contact"", ""Create a group"", customized list.107Choose “Create a New Group”108and we have a new group.109highlighted at the bottom of the screen and I will call it ""Marketing"".110You see the group ""Marketing"" down here and you will see its members in a moment.111You can112move someone to that group.113I will move around Fabrice as well.114Now I got 2 people in the new Marketing group.115Again, I can right-click and start a call, meeting, instant message chat with them ans so on.116I can add participants to that particular communication call or chat or whatever.117It's an easy way of adding multiple people to a group for organization and communication purposes.118You can communicate with them on mass in various ways by right-clicking on the name of the group119and then choosing the appropriate option.120That is different obviously from selecting an individual user121and choosing to send an IM that's going to start instant message with that one participant (myself and Fabrice in this case).122You could add more people to the call,123but it's obviously much quicker to select,124especially if these are small groups of people. If you have groups of 20 or 30 people125it's much easier to select the group and work with it that way.126Head back to the slides, contact groups.127Privacy relationships:128they control how much of your online presence information other people can see.129Each of your contacts has 1/5 privacy relationships with you.130Each relationship gives access to different amounts of information.131For example, the colleagues is the relationship new contacts are given by default when you add them.132They can learn more about where you are, when you'll be available and how to reach you for example,133than external contacts might.134But equally they can get less information than someone who's in the workgroup relationship.135There's another one called ""Friends and Family"" which gives more information than all the others together.136There's one exception to that in the contacts: workgroup.137That's one of those you can see on the slide called ""Workgroup"".138Let's maximize that slide and this workgroup.139They may need to find your work site.140For these contacts only, they can see your meeting location information141and get your attention via Skype for Business even if you set yourself to ""Do not disturb"".142We will talk about that in a moment.143These are the types of relationships.144Right-click a contact to change privacy relationship.145You can see on the slide the different levels of privacy you get.146Friends and Family: share your notes, location, contact information except meeting details.147Workgroup: share your notes, location, contact information except Home and Other phone but they can interrupt your Do Not Disturb status.148Colleagues: share notes, location, contact information except Home, Other and Mobile and meeting details but they can't interrupt your Do Not Disturb status.149External contacts: name, title, email, company and picture. No information on your notes or location or contact information.150Blocked contacts: name and email address and they can't reach you via Skype for Business.151Let's see that in the application itself.152Here are the relationships.153We can see our relationships and who's in those relationships: friends and family, workgroup, colleagues,154and then scroll down, we can see external contacts and blocked contacts.155There's no one in blocked contacts, but you can collapse and expand these156by clicking on this arrow to expand and collapse those relationships.157In terms of how people get added to them,158I will show you how to add a contact: I'm choosing a contact within my organization.159I could try and find a particular user.160Let's try in this case Fabien.161I can right-click Fabien and say ""Add to Contact List""162and ""Change Privacy Relationship"".163I can then select which relationship they should be in.164I'm saying that they're going to be in workgroup for example.165Then I can say in which which group: marketing.166He is copied in marketing.167In the relationships, he appears in workgroup.168When you add a new contact you select their privacy relationship as you add them.169Right-click on the person, change relationship to make him a colleague instead, I could do that.170Then that user will change to colleagues if we refresh that in a moment.171Now in terms of enriching our meetings.172Skype for Business enables you to enrich your communications in Skype173by doing things like transferring files,174sharing selected programs or your entire desktop.175You can display PowerPoint presentations176and you can use collaboration, co-authoring on documents in real time as well.177Within a chat or a meeting, you can click on the share content button.178That's this icon you can see in the center left,179that sort of arrow going up to the right top right of it.180Click on that button and choose the extra content you want to add.181If you already added it to share it182then choose the Manage Content option.183to actually manage the existing shared content you shared with other people.184At the top, you have ""Share your Desktop"" to share an entire desktop.185This might be quite useful for training purposes or help desk or showing someone what you're working on186rather than having to send them the document, file or whatever it is.187You can also share a window or share programs.188When you choose “Share a Window”, it asks you which of your currently opened applications you'd like to share with the user.189You can share PowerPoint files.190That's not exactly sharing the file, you're actually sharing sort of a presentation remotely191and you can then use annotation tools to work on those slides together and annotate them.192You can also Co-Author Office documents.193When you choose Co-Author Office doc. you can select meeting from OneDrive or somewhere194to then work collaboratively in real time with those other users in the call.195You might open a Word document and work at 3 or 4 on the same document at the same time,196working on different paragraphs, editing it and using online document with an online tool to access the document and work with it collaboratively.197You can also do things like add attachments, share notes.198When you click on the More button above Manage Content199you can also see extra tools like a white board for drawing200drawing, mapping out ideas, diagrams and so on.201There's also a polling tool: if you want to get feedback from people on particular questions, create a poll and ask people to respond. There's also a Q&A tool.202These are ways of adding extra enrichment to your meeting or call.203Let's go back and look at that in Skype.204I will change myself to available for a moment.205I will right-click on Guillaume and start instant message chat with that user.206Here's the share content button.207I can click on that and I got the menu we saw on the slide: share your desktop, share program,208share PowerPoint files and so on,209Co-Author Office documents, add attachments.210And this is more button to access the whiteboard or poll to get feedback and also Q&A session for presenters to answer.211Once you've actually got content shared, you can click on manage content,212which will then say that this is the content you're currently sharing in your meeting, your call, your IM,213what you want to do with it: stop sharing it and share with someone else or add something to it for example.214Let's choose an option.215If you share a window, it will ask you which one of your open applications you want to share,216it will show a list of all your currently open apps.217You can select which one you want to share.218If you choose to share desktop,219you can choose which desktop you're sharing220if you got multiple screens and you can select which screen you want to share.221If you share PowerPoint files, browse to find a file.222Let's do that one for example.223You can select the file and choose Open but we won't do it for now, it will take too long to load,224but you can then share that presentation.225You'll see a staging window where you can go through the slides and annotate together with the people in the call with you.226It is slightly different if you're working with someone using the public version of Skype.227Let's find someone.228This person here.229Right-click.230Click on the IM. This person is using the public version of Skype, not Skype for Business. I click on the content button.231It's much more restrictive in terms of what things they can share.232The options aren't sharing my programs or desktop, PowerPoint files.233I can still add attachments and co-author Office documents by sending links to documents, that kind of thing,234but none of the other possibilities for collaborating or interacting with someone using Skype for Business.235That's enriching our meetings.236In terms of customizing the interface of Skype237we got quite a few options.238We can use the alert section in the options239to configure interface settings for displaying alerts,240displaying how contacts are displayed if they are using public Skype for example.241Click on the cog icon so it opens up the options and then in the alert section that we can see on the page here.242We can see those options:243some general alerts, enabled taskbar notifications for offline and missed IMs.244Where should they appear: you can where those alerts should appear.245For example, if you tag someone when they come online, it wants to notify you and246you'll see those pop-up and it'll say when someone is Online again.247Or if someone's trying to send you something or a message chat,248you'll see that pop up in the corner249and you can choose top, left, right, bottom, etc.250If you have several monitors you can select which monitor it's on.251You can also choose things for Do Not Disturb:252don't show alerts,253show only alerts for people in your workgroup relationship254or show all alerts so it is slightly less restricted and they can break open the Do Not Disturb status to contact you should they need to.255Lastly, contacts that aren't using Skype for Business (public Skype, for example):256should they be able to contact you or do you block them.257It's on their settings down there on the alerts tab.258Then we got our status update.259You can use this section in options to specify how and to whom your status is displayed in Skype for Business.260If you've been inactive on your computer, Skype for Business automatically changes your status261and if you haven't moved your mouse or taken the keyboard action or something for a specified period of time262then Skype for Business changes status indication and chooses ""Inactive"".263After you've been inactive for a specified period of time, Skype for Business changes from Inactive to Away.2645 minutes is the default period for Inactive and then for Away265but you can specify a longer time for either or both of them.266The minimum you can specify is 5 minutes and the maximum is 360 minutes.267The privacy mode is the 2 buttons below that those status pin boxes.268Everyone except blocked contacts can see your present status.269To modify that setting, click on the options button, go to the status section in the options270and then choose one of the following options.271I want everyone to be able to see my presence.272We have the assistance settings, the default,273or you can choose the system administrator should decide.274Currently everyone can see your presence, but this could change if the system administrator changes that default setting to block other people from seeing you275depending on your organizations settings.276If they've already enabled privacy mode in Skype for Business,277you're going to see slightly different options than these previous ones.278You can use these options to limit visibility of your presence information279if your organization already enabled that privacy mode.280Then you're going to see an option that says ""I want everyone to be able to see my presence""281or ""I only want people in my contacts list to see my presence"".282It will change slightly what this status box looks like in your settings283if they've got the option on.284The Do Not Disturb part of your status:285you can set up to automatically block distracting communications if you are sharing content or giving a presentation286with your Skype for Business enabled computer.287If you enable that, it will change your status to ""Presenting""288whenever you share your screen or duplicate your display in projection mode for example.289Instant message chat with your coworkers will be blocked290and anyone who reads your status will know that you're currently presenting and not to be disturbed.291I will click back to my Skype to see that.292Remember I overrode this to say to make it choose available.293If I go back to reset status it says ""In a meeting"".294If I was showing my desktop through this Skype for Business, or sharing a PowerPoint file or something,295that would be saying ""Presenting"" so it's kind of a system-generated status up here.296Click on the cog icon, go to options,297for alerts this is where you come to choose on which display you should be showing those alerts,298the position on the monitor: top left, top right, bottom left, right, etc.299There's the options for your status when it's on Do Not Disturb,300whether you should see alerts or not.301Then under status where you can modify your settings,302let's say you make it 10 minutes and 20 minutes or something.303The minimum you can go to is 5, it doesn't go any lower than that.304These are the settings: you can choose to override the default configured by the administrator305and there's your options for Do Not Disturb.306Show me as Do Not Disturb when I'm showing my desktop or if it's being duplicated in sort of presentation mode.307It's very easy to get to that either from tools and options308or click on the arrow and choose tools, options,309but the quickest way is to click on the cog icon itself and it opens up the options dialog box.310Now in terms of equipment.311We can set up different bits of equipment to work with Skype for Business.312We'll see audio and video.313There's a couple options settings for things like ringtones and sounds and then audio and video devices.314You can set up to use your computer's built-in mic and speakers or headset315or another device for Skype for Business audio.316For the best audio quality during calls, there is a list if you search for optimized for Skype for Business online,317you'll see this list of optimized devices that work best with Skype for Business.318But on the whole most devices seem to work quite well with it.319You can also set up your video device320for having video calls. For best results, you can call set up and test your camera before you use it.321You need to have a camera to make video calls or if you want to share your video in a meeting322but you don't need one to receive a video call or see other peoples videos since you don't need to display and broadcast your own image.323When you make a video call, Skype automatically displays the video in a window,324but if you're in a Skype for Business meeting325it won't automatically share your video. You need to select it and say ""I would like to share my video by starting my video"".326Let's get back to the options.327You can see some of the options on the screen.328Let's switch out and put it in the live environment.329Ringtones and sounds you can see on the side:330choose ringtones, see a number, do you want to play sounds,331muting incoming alerts if you're in middle of an IM conversation,332play a sound when viewing an IM conversation and someone's typing...333You can choose to modify tones and so on.334Audio device: you can select your headset if you have multiple devices,335you can select one from that drop-down list.336You can test your speaker and ring to make sure it's working: you can see my microphone moving as I speak.337That's proving that the microphone is working and you can adjust those levels if you need to338for audio in and out.339Under video device settings,340I've got a camera plugged in here, you can see your camera and if you have multiple one, you can select in the list.341You can then choose your camera settings342that drags across.343You can use things like flipping the image344and mirroring it and all those kind of things,345black-and-white mode...346You can change things like the brightness in the color, the gamma correction and all that sort of stuff347to play around with until you get something that suits the lighting in your room, the outside, a dark or light room...348I will restore these options back to default settings.349Click OK to get back.350We can see a couple of other things here.351You've got the file saving options, if you're transferring files in calls352you can choose where they get transferred to.353If you're recording sessions, you can choose the location to save those recordings,354and the resolution of those recordings as well.355There's one on Skype meetings:356a couple options: what version of Skype for Business you're going to use,357whether to join audio using Skype for Business, or a phone device.358Whether to show IMs and participants and so on.359That's on your Skype meetings options.360The last thing I'll show you is the PBX options.361I will scroll down to that slide.362If you've got a PBX, a private exchange type desk phone363and it's configured to work with Skype for Business,364you can call people in your organization through Skype for Business365and the audio for the call will go through the phone rather than the headset or Skype itself.366It is a feature the admin has to configure if you're a company.367To tell if your company has enabled that functionality, you go to the options368and when you click on the gear icon to open up the options369you'll get options. If you see Call Handling as you can see on this slide,370then your desktop phone is configured to be integrated with Skype for Business.371All you have to do is set the outgoing calls option to use that number.372You can see that on the slide. Outgoing calls, use this number to make calls and you have a number to use for the outgoing calls.373To make a call you only have to start a Skype for Business call from your client machine.374Your desktop phone will ring, you pick up the desktop phone375then you will hear the other person's phone ringing and once they answer and connect376you can use the audio through your phones to conduct your call.377But even though you're using the audio over the phone378you can still use the collaborative tools in Skype for Business like instant messages, chats and sharing and so on379through the manage content and share content buttons.380That's the way of using a desktop phone for the audio portion381rather than using the Skype for Business PC audio headset type options.382You'll see that for example,383but it is not configured to do so: there's no Call handling and forwarding options since it is not configured to be set up with it.384A couple of things to summarize:385you can use the share content button to enrich your Skype for Business communications,386collaborating with people...387That includes things like showing desktop, windows, PowerPoint files, collaborating on documents in real time.388You can use the options button to customize the interface389and that's a general behavior for Skype for Business390like your status, where alerts appear, that kind of thing.391You can set up your audio and video equipment to work with Skype for Business,392for your calls and meetings.393You can also configure your desktop phone for audio if configured and if desired.394If you have questions, ask them in the chat and we will answer offline.395if there's no other questions at this point, then we can end the session.396Thank you for your time today.397Thank you for attending.398I hope you will make the best use of this resource going forward.399Thank you.",2017,N/A,[],[],[],1797.0,webcast

Some of your colleagues are alreadymaking use of tasks inOutlook to get organized.Others simply takeThis does not suit.You want everyone to have aglobal view of the progress.How to simply organize yourself and distribute the tasks to the team members? How to monitor progress and have a global view?Will you have to takestock with each collaborator?If you're in search of asimple way to organize this teamwork, Planner is a great choice.In my case, I need asimple but effective tool.I'm not an expert in planning andI don't need a very advanced tool.You'll find Planner inthe Office 365 application launcher or on the homepage.If you're a part of Office 365 Groups, you'll find them in the panel to the left of the Planner and in the main screen of the Schedule Center.Indeed Planner integratesGroups for more flexibility.When you create a group inOutlook, you can find them in Planner and when you create a new project or plan in Planner, you're actuallycreating a new work group.From Planner, I will thencreate a new plan for my project.That's it. It's very fastand I can very quickly enterinto the thick of things bycreating different buckets.Actually, there areseveral phases in my project.I will use buckets toorganize myself and have an overview of the different phases. For instance, there will be a preparatory phase which I'll call Conception.Then the Realizationand finally Deployment.I will now establish myTo Do list in each bucket.Beginning with theconception phase, you can prepare your To Do lists withoutnecessarily assigning them right awaynor indicating deadlines and details.I save it for later.That's it, my To Do list is ready.Nobody is present in thiswork group for the moment.Remember, while creatingmy plan, I also created an Office 365 group. So now, I'll be able to add members to this project and select collaborators who will have access to this plan either fromOutlook or directly in Planner.By simply typing the names orsurnames, the application offers me results.So I have my tasks on one side, theproject team members on the other.I will be able to assigntasks to each and add deadlines.To do this, I simply click on atask to open the detail window.I can assign it to ateam member who will then be notified of this new task by mail.Give it a start and end date.If necessary, create a checklist or alist of subtasks which can be checked.Add a description,attach files or links.I can now leave the screen.The task is saved. Of course, all those whom I appointed as members of this planwill be able to view this To Dolist and most especially keep it viable.After a few days or weeks ofuse, we will be able to seethe progress, viewentries from collaborators, etc.Taking stock hasnever been this easy.I use group reviews.Here I am grouping by buckets.I can use byassignments or by progress.Or better still, I canswitch to the charts view thatgives me a syntheticoverview of the progress, the number of tasks per person, taskswith exceeded deadlines and ongoing tasks. It is possible to have details of the tasks concerned bydirectly clicking on the graphs.Thanks to this analysis,it is possible to adjust my management by unloadingthe busiest people andreassigning certain tasks tothose who don't have any more.Finally, how Planner ispositioned in the Office suite?Outlook tasks are convenient, butare still for individual organizations.Projects are a very powerfultool, but not easy to handle.Planner is an excellentcompromise and offers simpleorganization possibilitiesat the level of a team withall collaborative toolsand a great ease of use.In addition, Planner iscompletely integrated and nestedto other Office 365 software.Thank you for your attention.",2017,Beginner,"['Project manager', 'Project management']",['Planner'],"['Organize', 'Collaborate']",293.0,use_case

In this video we will see the differentways of making a call using Skype.Before making a call, as wehave seen in the introductionvideo, first check theconfiguration of your audiodevices to avoid anyunwanted surprises.We will discuss thethree ways of making a call.The first way is thesimplest and most obvious.In the phone tab,you have a dial pad.This means you can eitheruse the dial pad directly orthe keyboard on yourPC to enter numbers.Or you can paste a numberthat you have copied from a webpage, for example,into the number field.Once a number has beenentered, you can use either theEnter key on thekeyboard or the Call button.This action will thendial and make the call.The second way is to makecalls using the lists fromeither the voicemail or call history.In the overview youwill find the Call iconwhich you can use to callsomeone back who has left a message.To find this, go to the call list. In the overview, the Call icon allows youto make a call to this contact.The third way is to startfrom your contact list eitherby just searching for theperson you want to contact orby looking directly inyour list of favourites.I'm going to browse over theimage of a person and in theCall Options I'm going toexpand the shortlist so that Ican choose the number thatI want to call for a contactwho has several phone numbers.A communication windowopens in which I find a buttonthat allows me toview the call controls.What are these call controls?Simply said, these consist of thedial pad which you can use during a call.The dial pad is particularlyuseful if, for example, youare using a voice server thatrequires you to key in choices.You will be able to do soby simply using the keyboardand the listeningvolume which can be adjusted.Going back to the main window thereis, of course, the option to hang up.There are two ways to enda call, either I can pressHang-up with this buttonhere, or I can close this windowdirectly which willallow me to hang up.In this case, a warning will pop upas closing the window mayhave been done instinctivelywithout realising thatthis will end the call.For this reason, Skypealerts you to let you know that ifyou close this window itwill end the call in progress.If this is intentional, simply clickOK and the call will be terminated.",2017,Beginner,[],['Skype Voice & Devices'],['Communicate'],162.0,tutorial

You can switch device completely,for example fromspeaker mode to headset mode, etc.Finally, the last thing youmay have noticed is that onceyou accept a call thestatus automatically changes andyou switch to In call whichtells other members of yourteam, most importantly ororganisation, that you are on acall and that they shouldperhaps avoid interrupting you then.From the moment you hang-upthe status will revert to Available.",2017,Beginner,[],['Skype Voice & Devices'],['Communicate'],160.0,tutorial

I can resume the other call and put it on holdin order to potentially take a third call as I please.In doing so, the two other calls willautomatically be puton hold independently.",2017,Beginner,[],['Skype Voice & Devices'],['Communicate'],114.0,tutorial

In this case, the person receivingthe call will, of course, be invited.Then, once he or sheanswers the call, I can exit thecall and leave the twoparties on the call together.So that's the first type oftransfer: transferring a call blind.That is to say, I havenot consulted the personbefore transferring the call.So it is a direct transfer.The second option when youare already on a call, is thatyou can also call or addsomeone to the call and thenhang up yourself, in order toleave the two parties on the call.In this case, what I'll dois use the Invite More Peoplebutton to add a person tothe call that's in progress.There's a small windowwhich will ask you to select theperson you want to add,or I'll number directly.The third person is invited.And when he or she accepts thecall, it will appear as you see it here.Now all three of us areparticipating in the same call.Meaning that we can havea three-way discussion.Now, in order to leavethese two people together, youjust need to hang upand leave the call.This will not terminate thecall completely because thetwo people will stay together and willbe able to continue the conversation.Finally, the third option:transferring a call with prior consultation.When I am on a call with afirst party, I will simplyinitiate a second call via theSkype window, like this, for example.This will enable me toput the first call on hold.When a second personanswers, I can then introduce theperson to them or explain thereason for the call being transferred.This method allows me toswitch from one to another if,for example, this persondoes not have much time andwants to know if thecall is urgent or not.I can always return to the firstcall and put the second call on hold.To clarify the request a little,discuss the reason for the call, etc.I can resume this calluntil this person accepts thetransfer, and in that case,I will then use the Transferbutton that can be found here.The window that lets youselect a contact opens.I will be able to choose thecurrent call as the transfer destination.It is this person I amcurrently talking to.I then select thisperson and transfer the call.Once I hang up, the two partieswill remain together on the call.We have looked at three ways totransfer a call on Skype for Business.",2017,Beginner,[],['Skype Voice & Devices'],['Communicate'],240.0,tutorial

31778,en,Teams - Is it a lever to make collaborative work easier,29.0,"Today we will talk about Teams: Is it a lever to make collaborative work easier? First we will see: What is Teams? So, the big question everyone thinks about.Next we will see ""Different Teams for Different Uses"". How can we use it? Is it really useful or not? Next the interface of Teams, the logic behind it.During the session, we will see a couple of extras. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to use the chat. I will read it and answer. We have the objectives of this session:Identify how Teams works and how you can promote it.And introduce yourself to Teams and the environment of Teams. This session will be about 30 minutes, so let's go.First, what is Teams? To tell you about it, I will go through the history of Teams.First is the Office 365 portal. I'm on it because it's where we find Teams in the center of your screen. If it's not there, you can find it in the top left corner in the app launcher in All apps.Teams is linked in history with the Office 365 Groups. What is Groups? I will go on Outlook to tell you.It's a Teams session but we will go in Outlook to see it. Don't worry, we will go in Teams afterwards.This is Outlook like everyone knows. On the left we have Groups. We can find them in Outlook and it was one of the first things that allowed teamwork on the Office 365 portal.With these Groups we can have conversations. It's not really instant conversation, it's more like an email conversation, but with all of the Groups for example, I will go on a group here.We have old conversations from last year and recent conversations. Everyone can talk with all the members and they will have everything. I am telling this because with those Groups we have conversations,a file tab, a calendar tab or a notebook, a lot of things. We can find the same things on Teams. But what is the difference between those two? Groups was the first of the two.It is the ancestor of Teams if I could say. We can find the functionality of Groups in Teams but with new features, a better interface. It may be a bit more logic to navigate through Teams than to navigate through Groups.But if you use Groups you will have no problem to use Teams since it's the same logic.So now I will go on Teams to show you what it's about.What’s the logic behind Teams? On the left, we have everything we can do on Teams, activity chat, Teams, Meetings, etc. We will see through this during this session. First and the most important thing is the Teams tab.It is the core of Teams since we can create teams.What can teams be used for? A team can be used for as many things as you want,  for example for a project. I create a team just for it.In this project you can have different channels which are to divide a project in something. For example, if you have a part about realization, about the analysis, you can split your team into different channels.You can add teams directly and easily just by clicking on the button, create a team from scratch or join a team. I talked about Groups earlier, if you already have groups that you created,you can create a team from a group since it is the same logic behind it.So, you won't lose everything,you won’t have to a cut all your files or invite members in the new team, you can do it directly from a group.We can have different teams with different channels. When you create a channel, you have a general channel first, but you can create as much as you want.The logic in Teams is just the 3 dots to access more options, Add channel, Manage team. I will let you discover it by yourself.Once you have created a channel, you can add different tabs to your team for your projects or to manage a team, etc.The conversation tab is to interact with everyone. It's is a lot like a group tab: You can send messages, it's not it's instantaneous but even if someone doesn't answer immediately,they can answer in 2 weeks, there is no problem and there is a version history, remove people from Teams, etc. You can go through conversations, late January, without any problem.A File tab: You can link every file directly there.You can link those files with a channel specifically You can have as many tabs as you want in each channel. If you don't have any use for the Files tab in the realization channel, don't use it.If you need it in the analysis channel, maybe you should consider to use it.So, you can have tabs, you can add as many tabs as you want, tabs for the Office 365 application Excel forms OneNote or even for applications that are not Microsoft.YouTube, PowerApps, etc. You can use them directly in Teams and you will just have to click on a tab to go to it.You can centralize a lot of of information directly in a team, add as many tabs as you want.The tab  you create directly with the Office, 365 applications like Planner or OneNote will be specific to a team. For example, if you add a Planner, you will directly have a Planner created for you team.You won’t have to go to Planner to create it, modify it or add it to Teams.Its link is synchronized so you won't have to go from a software to another one and switch between them all the time. Teams is synchronized with most of the applications of Office 365.It may be the best point about Teams, it centralizes information. You won't have to go to Planner, OneNote or SharePoint, just go to Teams and you will find everything you want directly in the Files tab,the Planner tab or the SharePoint tab. You will have everything you need in one place and it may be the point you should consider when you are using Teams.We can do a lot of different things with Teams: You can link directly a tab with connectors for example, you can link a tab with Forms, Twitter, Yammer, you can link a channel with anything you want.An interesting fact with Teams is that it's not just limited to Office 365 applications but even in the connectors or in the Files tab. I can obviously take files from OneDrive, SharePoint since it’s a Microsoft application.But I can also add other cloud storage. If I need, for example, Dropbox files, I can directly link Teams with Dropbox or even with Google Drive. So if you are usually using Dropbox,you won't have to transfer all your files in SharePoint. You can just link there.It works with a lot of applications without having to do a lot of things. You just have to link it, no need to transfer or change all your files.You can create tabs in a channel to access directly and quickly different applications. You can connect to Channel with Yammer, Twitter and you can even add different storage spaces directly in Teams.So that's it for the uses you can make of teams and channels. You also have a lot of different things. Teams centralizes a lot of possibility. You can directly go to SharePoint to Planner.And have a conversation with your coworkers, but you can also go to a chat. You have a chat like you could have on Skype. If you don't really like using Skype you can use Teams, call people, add people and have conversations with different people.An interesting fact is that you also have access to tabs directly in a chat conversation. You are interacting with 2 people; you don't have to create a team if you just want to share 3 files. Obviously, you can send it as an attachment with Outlook,but you can also go in Teams and you have your Files tab. You can find everything you want even if the file was uploaded on this tab a year ago.It centralizes some functionalities you can find somewhere else like on Skype for example. You can also create meetings directly in Teams.I think everyone is used to go in Outlook to create a meeting, invite people. There you can schedule directly your meeting in Teams with the same possibilities you have in Outlook.Add titles, locations… It’s almost the same as Skype. In the location, you can have online, like in a team meeting, and select a channel to meeting.For example, I want to pick a channel in my project, the Analysis, so I will do a meeting in this channel. Everyone who has access to it can join the meeting. You can also invite people if you wish.For the other things: The start, the end, I won’t bother you with it.You can find a lot of functionalities that allow you to collaborate through other software: Share files with SharePoint or OneDrive, have a OneNote just for the team.For example, you were used to send your notebook if you needed to share something to someone. Now you don't have to, you can create a notebook in a tab and it will ask you if you want to create one to browse your notes or paste a link.You can create everything you need from scratch directly in Teams instead of going to all the applications. It's also way easier to navigate in just one software.Maybe at the start it will be a bit difficult to navigate in Teams. But for a basic user it's easier to navigate in one software that is Teams than to learn to navigate in SharePoint, Outlook, Skype, OneDrive or Planner.You have one place that centralizes everything you need.Also, you have other tabs. A Files tab so you can directly see your recent documents, “Book” in this OneDrive, in this tab “Communication”, etc.You can directly find what you need directly in these files. And an Activity file to see the feed or the activity of my team. My activity to have to be sure to see what we want to see.On the top right corner, you have different settings so you can set up things as you want:The notification settings. Do you want to receive an email if someone changes something in a team? I will go to see it rapidly.If the team role changes, if someone is invited in your team, do you want an email? Just a banner? Just in the feed? It’s as you wish; you can customize it as you want. Today I was presenting Teams via the online application, but you can also use the desktop application if you need.There is not that much difference but for example, in the Chat part, I can call someone, exchange emails but in the online application I can't do a video to share my face.So, what is Teams? It's a tool that centralizes everything you need about collaborative work and it's pretty easy to navigate. Just create a team with different channels: A team for a project, the steps of your project, so you can split everything as you need.Maybe for a big project you have a lot of people but not everyone is interested by the realization part, so they just won’t to have to go to the realization part. They could see what's in it, so they are not totally lost when you tell them:“Go to this and see what we can do.” To help them, you have different channels.I think that's all I had to say. I will just check the PowerPoint . We saw what is Teams, we went through a bit of history,Teams, Groups. Just to remind you, in Groups you had all the options that you have in Teams, even less. For example, you couldn't directly organize meetings or chat with audio calls with Groups but you can do it with Teams.Teams allows you to limit the number of applications you need to do a specific thing. You just need one application butif you need other options for a file, you can open in SharePoint, but you won't have to go to SharePoint for the basic things, like edit it, move it, copy it, download it. For example, if you want their version history, you need to go on SharePoint but for the basics you can stay on Teams and it will be enough.Like in Planner, you can have most of the functionalities. But if you really need to see a different plan that you created, go on Planner instead of just checking all your teams to see if things you are interested in are there.Teams can be used for different things, for a project, with your coworkers so you can share information when you have to. We saw the interface with on the left the different functionalities.In the middle left, our teams and our working space on the right. It's the same logic everywhere. And if you need right click you will still have most of the options: Favorites, Mute, Disable tips and tricks, Hide, etc.The couple of extras, I won’t list them all, but we saw some extras in this session.I won’t repeat myself again about what is Teams and the centralization part of this, but do you have any questions? You can use the chat at the top of Join.me if you need to ask me any questions.You want to know if we can have a specific user for a channel.You can add people in a team but for the channel you can't really invite people to one channel and not the team. If someone is in the channel, they’re obviously in the team so they can have access to all.So yes, the same people in teams and in the channel; So if you have some confidential things that you don't want people to see, Teams may not be the best tool since it's really collaborative.You have one team for one project for example, everyone can have access to the things in the channel. But if you need confidential work, you can create other teams or maybe use other applications to send something by email.Any other question?About external people.It can be accessed by external people, but it depends on the authorization, the security part of Teams,how the administrator makes it. If you don't want to be external people to access it, it won't be possible, but it's possible by default.Any other questions?If you don't have any questions, I will just ask you to go to your MOOC with the learning paths, the courses, tutorials, etc. And go to My account to evaluate the session.If you liked it or not, what was good, what was bad. I just ask you to answer honestly. First we can know that you were there and it can be important for us to improve our session in the future.Thank you for your participation in this session.Have a nice day. Maybe see you another time on another session.",2018,N/A,[],[],[],1688.0,webcast

To do this I can go to Create and then to Create a group in order to create a group of people directly in Stream or to create a channel if the group already exists.In Creating a channel, I will select the Group channel option. This allows me to link this channel to an existing Office 365 Group. By doing a search, it is possible to find a group that was previously created in Teams or Outlook.The channel has now been created. The next step is to upload the videos to the channel simply by dragging and dropping them. While doing so I make sure that this option has been unchecked, so that only the people in the group can watch the videos. Once the videos have been uploaded they must be published.Now I will make these videos available to the group members. To do this I'm going to use Teams. In the relevant channel, I'm going to add a Stream tab.All I need to do is paste the URL for the channel I created and that's it. Only the members of this group will be able to view the videos.For my part, on the Stream page, I will be able to track the viewing statistics, the likes and comments. With Stream, you can put video content online in a few minutes. You can easily control access to these videos by creating your own channels and using Office groups.",2018,N/A,[],['Stream'],[],153.0,use_case

40525,en,Discover the visual tool for decision support,29.0,"Welcome in this presentation of Power BI. In the first part of this presentation, I would like to explain to you the purpose of Power BI. Then we will go to Power BI Desktop in order to create our first report. We will publish it and we will share it from Power BI service.2Before everything else, let's explain what Power BI is. Power BI is a free business analytics service for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data. You can create reports and dashboards by yourself without having to depend on information technology staff3or database administrators. Then you can share and collaborate in any reports or dashboards with your coworkers.4Power BI consists in a Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online service called Power BI service and Power BI mobile applications. This 3 elements, the Desktop version, the service version and the mobile application version, have been designed to allow you5to create, share and consume business data, according to your needs. The common activity flow into Power BI is to first integrate data into Power BI Desktop and create our first report. Then we will publish the report in the Power BI Service, where we can generate dashboards.6We will share our dashboard with others from Power BI service and will view shared reports and dashboards in the Power BI mobile apps. We will see later that it's possible to create your visualizations directly from Power BI Desktop and you can also create reports from Power BI online service.7Just to let you know, to create a report it's recommended to use Power BI Desktop because you have more advanced analysis tools for your data.8So now let's go to Power BI Desktop to create our first report.9Welcome in Power BI Desktop. As always in the Office applications, we find tabs and ribbons at the top of the page to find our features.10Our first step will be to add some data from the Get Data button. I will select the More button to show you all the connectors available.11As you can see, there are many that you can use to get data. It can be, for example, from an Excel file, a SharePoint folder, an access database, an Azure database, a Salesforce account, etc. In my example, I will select an Excel file.12Once we have selected our Excel file, I need to select the good days because, potentially, I could have more than one base in the same document. So this is a good base I want to use. I can click on the Load button.13Once we have loaded our data, we can see now that the pane Fields on the right side is full of data. I need to repeat the operation to add a second database. So we click again on the Get Data button and then on Excel.14As you can see, there are two tabs in my Excel document so I will pick the good one, the first one, with the data I need. I can now load the data and once again, I will see the data from the pane Fields on the right side.15If needed, we can sort and filter our data from the data tab using the re-editor.16Let me show you that. From the left pane, there is a second icon Data where we can edit our data. For example, if all the data in the database is not useful for my coworkers. What can I do? I can just click on the Edit Queries button from the ribbon and17I will be able to manage everything for my data. For example, in my example, I just don't want to see Product number 4. I just don't want to see this column and as you can see I can remove it. I can also just sort my names18in an ascending way, for example. So you can make all the modifications you need. Once you are done sorting and filtering data don't forget to close and apply your modifications.19Next step before creating our first visualization. We need to create a relationship between our two tables to cross the data. You can do that, from the left pane in the third icon Relationships or we can do that also from the ribbon. There is a button here Manage Relashionships.20 21If you already use Power Pivot from Excel, you won't be lost. It's more or less the same way to use it.22In fact, in most cases, you won't have to do anything. You have right here the Autodetect feature. We can do it for you. If you do that, cardinality, cross-filter direction and active properties are automatically set up. You don't need to do anything.23However, in some cases, you may have to create relationships yourself or you may need to make some changes to a relationship. In this case you can click on the New button.24In this window, you may have to create a relationship.25In this window, in the first table drop-down list,26select a table, for example the first one.27Then select the color you want to use to make the link between your two tables.28So I'm going to select the other value right here. For example, first name with first name.29I can now click on OK. Just for your information, visit the first presentation of Power BI so we won't speak, we won't develop the options of cardinality and cross filter directions. I can now validate my relationship and as you can see it is all setup.30I can close this window. We are ready to create our first visualizations in our report. So let's come back to the first tab.31Our report and as I said there are many pages in your report. By default we only have one, as you can see I am on the first page. But if I need it I can create any pages I need by clicking on this symbol, the Plus.32I will select visualizations and data, according to my needs. For example, some charts right here. And as you can see once I select the visualizations, this visualization is empty. This is normal, I didn't select any data.33That's why now, I need to go in the Fields pane to select the good data I would like to to see in these visualizations. For example, I would like to see all the sales of my products34 35for my team, so for example, I can fill all the products sold by my team right here. I'm just going to add some visualizations to give you more examples. I'm going to add another one for example, this time, we will choose a clustered column chart and this time, I would like to see36my sales by managers.37You know there are two managers, I can see each sale by managers. What can we add more? We will add pie charts for example, for the demonstration38with product 2 and product 3. That's it. And finally I would like to just add a map. It will be easier for me to understand how I made my sales. So once again I need to select some data for the map. I will select, for example, the cities and39the names of my coworkers. That's it.40What is really good about the way to create a report is you can just customize and set up everything you need. As we can see I can just reduce or expand visualizations. I can also for example, change the data. By default, I have a sum.41If I want an average, it's possible. Just let me show you that. If you want to customize or configure any visualization just click on it, and then from the Visualizations pane, you will find 3 tabs: Fields, Format and Analytics. From the 3 tabs, you will be able to manage42your visualizations if you want to add a background, a caption. If you want to change the style of your chart, if you want to change anything, you can do it from here. Just remember that this is really useful. As I said, by default, we have a sum but we could change our data43to get the minimum, the maximum or just an average. Just remember that this is really useful to use that but this kind of features are not available for Power BI service. Because we can create a report from Power BI Service, but some features won't be available.44This is a good example.45What you have to know about visualizations is that the display is totaly dynamic. For example, I can select a specific city on my map, for example, Madrid and I will see all the other visualizations adjusted according to what I selected in my map.46So for example, if I just select Madrid, I will see only the sales of my coworkes done in Madrid.47On the contrary, I could select directly someone from my first visualizations. For example, Mr. Duval. If I click on the Duval name, I will see only the place where I sold some products and I will see only the manager for whom he is working. In my example it is Jean-Yves.48So just remember that any displays for visualizations are dynamic. This is really good, but just to give you this information: this is true for reports, this is not true for dashboards. Just remember that. I will show you that later.49As I said, we can customize also any visualizations, change the values of the captions, etc., from the Visualizations pane.50I could go on and create several pages on my report. Let's imagine we just finished and we are ready to publish our report and to share it with our coworkers. If I want to publish our report on Power BI service, I need to click on the Publish button in the ribbon.51I will say yes, I want to save my changes and then I will name this report.52Once it's saved, I will have the opportunity to publish it into my workspace. I will show you that in a few seconds or into any SharePoint site or Teams site. Just for information, it's possible to publish any report into SharePoint or in Teams, I will select53my workspace and normally once it's done, I should see a link to reach directly Power BI service. That's perfect. I succeeded to publish my report and now I can open it from Power BI.54Let me show you that. Welcome to Power BI service and now let me explain a bit how to use Power BI service. As you can see, I can see my report right here and I will be able, if I need it, to share it from the ribbon. There is a button Share right here.55So first thing I would like to show you. Let's see a bit of the left pane. You will find all your favorites and your apps. What is an app? It's a collection of dashboards and reports. It's just a good place to easily find your reports and56most used dashboards. Just to let you know.57From my workspace, I will be able to consult any dashboard, report, workbook and dataset I get into Power BI. As we can see, if I go in Reports, I should be able to see the report I just created with you.58Let me give you some information about the sharing. If you want to share a report, you can open your report and do it directly from the report or you can do it from this page.59If, for example, we want to share the first report, I will use the second icon Share. What you have to know about sharing. Whether you shared content is inside or outside the organization, you need a Power BI Pro license.60Your recipients also need the Power BI Pro license or the content needs to be in a premium capacity. This is a special version to allow any people who doesn't have a Power BI Pro license to display your report and to share your report with them. I won't give you more details about it61but just to let you know it's possible. To summarize, you can use Power BI for free. But if you need to share your report or dashboards, you need a Power BI Pro license or you need to create a report in premium capacity.62 63So when you share a dashboard or report, those you share it with can view it and interact with it but the can't edit. They see exactly the same data that you can see in your dashboard or report.64The coworkers you share with can also share with their coworkers if you allow them to. Let me show you that: if I click on the Share button, there is a box Allow recipients to share your report.65 66People outside your organization can view and interact with the dashboard or report but they can't share it. So this box, Allow recipients to share your report, is only for internal people. If you just share report with someone external, they won't be able to share it to someone else, just to let you know.67 68So let's share it. I'm going to add an email address for my coworker, for example Chad, and I'm going to click on the Share button.69Now that my report is shared my colleague Chad can consult it on Power BI mobile, apps or service. We could also have created a specific dashboard for Chad to select only the relevant visualizations for him. So let me show you that: if you want to create any dashboard or report from Power BI service,70we will use the Create better from the ribbon. Then I will choose Dashboard and will name my dashboard.71Once it's created I'm ready to add some visualizations on it. To do that, I need to select my reports, my visualizations from the report. And for example, if I want to add this visualization to my dashboard, I just have to click on72the Pin icon right here and then I will need to choose in which dashboard I want to pin it. So it will be, for example, the dashboard we just created together. I'm going to pin these visualizations. Let's pin another one,73for example this one. Once again I will click on the Pin Visual icon and then I will pin it to my dashboard. That's it. Let's come back to our dashboard to be sure that we can see our visualizations. Yes, we can, that's great, we can see it. Just remember that, as I said, this is a dashboard it means that74visualizations are not dynamic. If I click on one of my visualizations, I will just open the report directly. It is just like a link, like a shortcut to the report. So remember that.75The display is dynamic on the report and not on the dashboard. Just to let you know, it is really important to know that.76Now we know how to create the first report. We know how to import some data. We know also how to create a dashboard and share it with our coworkers. To conclude this presentation, know that Power BI is a really powerful and complete tool. We didn't see all the possibilities of use.77This presentation was intended to make you understand the utility of Power BI, and give you the basics to get started with Power BI.78Thank you very much for your participation and have a good day, thank you.",2018,N/A,[],[],[],1156.0,webcast

43696,en,Sway - Create an interactive panel,18.0,"Hello and Welcome to this presentation on Sway. This is your trainer speaking, my name is Antoine. Thank you very much for being here.2Before starting I would like to give you some information about this presentation. So this presentation will be recorded and made available on the MOOC Office 365 platform.3Also in order to have a clear sound your microphones are turned off, so please if you have any questions feel free to ask in the chat. I will take a few minutes at the end of the presentation to answer all your questions.4Let's see the plan of this presentation. About the plan, we will explain in 2 minutes what Sway is. Then we will start our first Sway from the web app. We will see that we can start from a blank Sway or document, a template or even a topic suggested by Sway.5So I will show you all the options available to start your new Sway. After that, we will format it and, once finished, we will share it with our colleagues. So my first question is: What is Sway? What can we do with Sway? I'm going to try to give you a small introduction about it.6Sway is a new app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, personal stories, presentations and more. You will start by adding your own texts and pictures, search for an import relevant content from other sources and then you have to watch Sway do the rest. You will see it's very easy.7You're no longer limited to picking a pre-designed template that makes your presentation looks like everyone else's and you don't have to have any design skills to transform and broadcast information in a modern and interactive way. There's no need either to spend lots of time on formatting.8Its building design engine takes care of making your creation look its best. If the initial design doesn't quite match your test, you can easily apply another one or fully customize your layouts to make it your own. So you will see there are many options for customization.9Once you are done creating your Sway, it's super easy to share it. Your colleagues and partners can see your creations on the Web, signing in or without signing up. , you can change the privacy settings for any Sway whenever you want for more control over what you will share.10I would like also to give you another information before starting to create our first Sway. It's good to know that Sway is free to use for anyone with a Microsoft account but you can create more sophisticated Sways with more content when you use Sway as part of an Office 365 subscription. So to let you know,11you will get more content and you will be able to get more sophisticated Sways. I won't go further about the plan. I will go directly to the application. So let's discover Sway. The first thing you need to know if you want to access Sway,12you need to log in on your Office 365 portal and then you will find the Sway tile in the middle. If you can't find it here, I invite you to click on the Web app launcher on the left corner and then you will find the Sway tile right here.13Let's discover now Sway. You will see in few seconds from the main page I can see all my existing Sways. You can see them in the middle of my page. I will explain to you in details aach tab during this presentation, but to let you know from the Analytics tab,14right here, you can also have statistics on the consultation of my Sways. I can see all the people who saw my Sways and I have some statistics about it. to show you that really quickly, the Deleted tab allows you to restore a Sway that you deleted you have 30 days15to restore a Sway. After that, it's not possible anymore. So remember that if you make a mistake, you delete your Sway, it's OK, you can still restore it from this tab. Let's come back to the first tab. I would like to explain to you a few things about the way to start your Sway.16If you want to start your Sway there are many options. You can start from a blank page: there is a button here Create New. Let me show you that. If we do that, we will have to build our Sway from the beginning. We will have to add everything: pictures, text, we will have to format it, we will have to choose a style,17we will have to do everything from the beginning. So this is the first option available. We will do that in a few minutes. I want to show you the other options before. What you can do also, you can start from a template. It could be good if you have no idea about how to start your Sway.18You have to choose one from that list and then, let me show you that, you can consult the Sway already existing.19If like this one, if you like this template, if you want to use it to create your first Sway click on the button Start editing this Sway. Let me show you that, this will be really easy. I have to edit my card and I will also be able to add pictures and cards.20This is a good way to start your first Sway if you have no idea how to start.21There is also something really useful if you have no idea how to start. You can do it from a topic: there is a button on top Start from a topic and I'm going to give you an example. If I click on it, I will choose a topic, for example dinosaur.22And then I will click on Create outline.23So this is really good to have a solid starting point and then I will be able to continue building the rest of my Sway. As you can see it is still loading. In a few moment, I will see there is there is a lot of information on it, a lot of content. We can see that there is some text, some pictures, etc.24For your information, we are still on the edit mode, it means this is not what your Sway will look like when someone plays it. I will show you in a few moments from the Play button how it looks, .25The last option, we can do, let me show you that: we can start from a document. If for example you already have a PowerPoint document that you want to use to create a presentation, you can do that from this button Start from a document. I'm going to show you that: I will find a document from my computer.26I will load it and then Sway will try to build my Sway with the document I selected. I will have a lot of things to change, but at least I will have a lot of content. I will need to format everything. This is according to the document I loaded.27Then I can customize everything on it.28Just remember that there are 4 options to start your Sway. You can start from a new blank Sway, from a topic, from a template or from a document. Let's start our first way from a new blank page.29So I will use the first button Create New.30We are by default on the Storyline tab. There are two tabs: Design and Storyline. Let me explain to you the first tab Storyline. The storyline is where you type insert, edit and format the content that tells your story.31Content is arranged in sequential order by adding cards containing the type of content you want, such as text, images, videos and even Ofice documents. The order of cards can be rearranged at anytime to switch your needs.32We can start by giving a name to our Sway and choosing an image. So I click on Title your Sway shown in the first card on the storyline.33So we have to choose a title. Type a short but meaningful description of what your Sway is about. When you later share your finished Sway, this title will be the first thing others will see, so it is really important to choose a meaningful description.34Now let's add a photo. I can add a photo by clicking on the background button but you can also use the drag and drop in Sway. So we could drag a picture and it should also work. When I click on this button, I can load a picture from my device,35from my computer, from my OneDrive, but also from the web. If I have no pictures about dinosaurs, for example, I will type Dinosaur36in the Search field and I should be able to load any photo from the web for example, this one. I'm going to add this picture. About pictures, I have a few things to explain to you. Whenever you add pictures, Sway tries to identify thins like faces,37horizons and other strong lines. Sway then considers all of these elements work together and where the picture is being used. You have to understand that. How much of the inserted image will be shown and which parts may be cropped further depends on the constraints of your current devices as well as38the applied layout and style. So I'm going to give you a trick about it. You can easily mark the most important parts of an inserted picture to make sure that those parts are always shown in your Sway. Do the following: click on the Focus Points button.39If you want to add focus points to the part of the picture you always want shown in your Sway, click on these areas in the selected picture.40You can add as many focus points as you want. To change any existing focus points, drag it to the new location you want. We can change the location when we drag it. To delete it click again on it and that's it.41If you want to always show the entire picture in your Sway, select this box The entire image is important. If you want to reset the picture to its original state, click on the Reset button.42In my example, I would like to see the entire image. So I tick the box The entire image is important. I can close this window.43If we want to add more content to a Sway, such as text, images or videos, we need to click on the tab or tap the plus icon at the bottom of any existing card. As I said, we can also use the drag and drop if we want to drag and drop any text or image.44Don't hesitate to experiment: you can change the order of your content at anytime and customize each card the way you want.45As you can see, there are many options on it. For example, if we added a card with text, we can use the formatting toolbar. I just need to write something on it, and then if I need I can use the formatting toolbar on top.46If you want to insert more content and you don't find everything you want from the plus button, there is also the possibility to use the Insert button from the ribbon Insert content in your Sway.47Select your preferred content source from the menu. As you can see, we can select videos for example, and then we will type the name of the  video we are looking for in the Search field. My theme is a dinosaur so I will stay on with dinosaurs and I will add for example, a short video.48This one, for example. I will validate by clicking on the Add button.49As you can see, there are many possibilities, we can add many contents. I could keep going on like that for 30 minutes, but this is not the point of this presentation. Now we have the basics to start your first Sway. You understood that we can start from a new page, from a document50from a template or from a suggested topic, and then from any Sway, from the storyline tab, you can customize the content of any card and you can add several cards by clicking on the plus icon.51I just repeat that, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the chat. I will have a look at the end of the presentation and I will take a few minutes to answer your questions.52Now let's see how we can change the style of our Sway. We said before Sway takes care of the formatting, design and layout of your content. You can keep it or you can select and apply your own and even customize layouts if you need it.53To choose a style for your Sway, we need to switch to the Design tab. I will click on style from the ribbon on the right side column.54If you want to control how others will view and navigate your Sway once you have shared it, select whether your content should scroll vertically, horizontally or appear like a presentation. So there are 3 options here.55Just to show you the differences: horizontal,56vertical,57and if you prefer like a presentation, like slides.58There is also another trick I would like to give you, this is not an obligation to use it. But if you have no idea about the style you want for your Sway, you can also use the Remix! button on top59to choose a random look. If you click on it,60I'll see another kind of styles I can apply if I need it. If I keep clicking on it, I will see different styles. If you have no idea click on the Remix! button, this is really helpful.61You can also adjust specific parts of the currently applied style, such as the colour, the font and the textures by clicking on the Customize button. Click on it and you can change the colors,62the font, we can change many things from that tab. Just remember that, w can go further: for example, you can also change the text size. For example, I would like to have a bigger text. In the example the text is bigger.63I can make it smaller. So remember that, you can go really far with the styles and the customization of your Sway.64Now we created and customized our Sway, we are ready to share it. But before I would like to have an overview, a preview of my Sway. You can do it from any tab, from the Design tab and also from the Storyline tab. There is a Play button on top.65If you click on it, you will see how your Sway looks.66 67If you need to edit it, there is a button on top. You can also share it from here or you can click on the 3 dots to duplicate this Sway or save it as a template. It could be great, if you created an amazing Sway you can save it and you will be able to use it for another Sway or you can also share it with someone else.68You can share a Sway for co-edition but also for consultation and your coworkers could use it to create their own Sways if they need it .69Now we are ready to share it. I click on the Share button on top and I would like to explain this window to you. In your Sway, there are 3 available permission levels: specific people or groups, those in your organization with the link and70anyone with the link. By default, those in your organization with the link security settings is preselected for you. No one will be able to find your Sway unless you send them the link. But these different permission levels can make the Sway even more secure is it contains sensitive information.71Let me give you more details about the 3 options. Specific people or groups, the first one: Only people or groups within your organization for who you explicitly granted permission will be able to view or edit your Sway. When you send a view or edit link to72specific people, they will be required to sign in so they can see your Sway. This is the most secure setting so use this option for sensitive or confidential information that you don't want to share publicly.73The second one, those in your organization with the link: Only people at your work will be able to view or edit your Sway and they also need to sign in to be able to see it. Be sure to use this option for sensitive or confidential information that74only people in organization should see. Because, be careful, if we are working in the same company, if I share a Sway with Mark, he can forward my link to Leah and Leah is also working in my company so she will be able to see my Sway. This is not possible with the first possibility Specific people or groups.75This is the big difference. Be careful, the coworker with whom you share your Sway can forward the link to someone else in the company and this other person will be able to see your Sway, so be careful. Finally if you choose Anyone with a link, only people who have been given76the link to your Sway will be able to view or edit it. Be careful, this is the same thing: this link can be forwarded to someone else, even someone external to a company. This is not secured like the first one. Remember these few options.77Then we also have to decide if our colleague can only view my Sway or if they can also edit it. There are two buttons: Invite people to view it or to edit it. View it like only consultation, they can't modify anything on it. Edit it, they will be able to build your Sway,78to delete some cards you already added, etc. Once you are ready, you can get your visual link and share it with who you want. There is a button Get visual link. Click on it and then click on the Copy button. You can then pass this link into a Skype conversation,79an email, whatever you want.80I made an overview of all these possibilities. I would like to make a small conclusion before answering to your questions. To conclude this presentation, remember Sway allows you to create your professional looking,81interactive presentations, newsletters, tutorials and you don't have to have any design skills to transform and broadcast your Sway.82Sway works in all modern mobile browsers, regardless of platform, and is always just a tap away. You can also download freely the Sway mobile app to use it even on the go. You will find it in any market, iPhone, Android, etc.83I will have a look at your questions and I will try to give you an answer. Thank you everyone for your presence and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the chat.84Laurence, I saw your questions. Yes, you can start from any PPT or Word documents. With Publisher, it's not allowed yet. But as I said, It's a new application. You can give your feedbacks, if there are many people who want that I'm pretty sure they will make an update to add this possibility.85For now, you can start from a PowerPoint or Word document.86I'm going to come back on the first page, Start from a document and as I said, I can use any Excel document. I made it with the PowerPoint documents but I can do it with a Word document.87Yes, Laurence, even if you shared your Sway with someone else and for example, you picked only for specific people, you can switch to another permission level whenever you want according to your needs. You can change that, there is no problem at all.88From the main page, I would like to show you something quickly. I guess my coworkers stopped the sharing. I had one Sway shared on my screen here and I could see that there is an icon to see how many people saw this Sway.89If it's my own Sway, I will be able to enter it and to change any sharing options, but don't worry Laurence, it's possible.90If you need to watch another tutorial video, to go further about it I invite you to consult the MOOC Office 365 platform and also from the application, there is a button Tutorials: You can watch videos about Sway.

45028,en,PowerApps - Creating an application for your field agents in just a few minutes,145.0,"Your company’s main activity is based on interventions in the homes of your customers. Each time that your field agents intervene, they need to fill out an intervention sheet and then retype the data in an Excel file that you shared with them. This double data entry is a waste of time and money for your company. Your agents are asking for a solution so that it will be easier for them to enter data and especially so that they don’t have to enter it twice. How can you make data entry easier during interventions? Is it practical and quick to use the Excel mobile version to enter the data directly in the shared file? How much time will it takeand what will it cost to order an application that would facilitate data entry for your workers? Microsoft PowerApps can help you. In just a few minutes, it can produce a professional application with no particular knowledge in programming required. In my example, I’m going to build an application for data entry in forms that will automatically fill in my Excel file.On the PowerApps home page, you have several options. You can start the application creation from scratch, from data, and from existing templates. In my case, I want to start from an Excel chart. So I’ll choose the option “from data”.The advantage of this option is that PowerApps will generate a complete and functional application for me in a few seconds. It will consider that my column headings are fields where you can enter data in the application. Before generating this application, I can check here to see what it will look like.I’m going to choose “Make this app” to start, and then the space where my data will be stored. I choose the file in question and then the data table. Finally, I log in to start creating the application. By default, the application generates three screens. The first one allows you to browse all the items. You will then find a screen to display the details of an item, and a screen to add and edit items. My application is ready to be used. To see how it works, I use this button at the top right of the interface.This suits me. I can now share this application with my agents, or I can begin to customize it. I can change the theme of the application, the labels and the items to be displayed here.By clicking on the data source, I have the option of aligning the items, changing the layout, sorting the items and removing some of them. To make data entry easier for my agents, it is better to change the items “Agent_name” and “Intervention_type” in the drop-down list of predetermined choices.This is quite simple. I will choose the type next to the name of the item and then “Allowed Values”. Next, in the Advanced section, I fill in the choices in the Items field by using this writing style. My application is now ready to be shared. To do so, I go to the File menu, I give it a name, I choose an icon and I save my work.I can then select Share this app to make it available to my agents. Here, I have two options: I can fill in the names of the agents one at a time, or I can make the application available to everyone in my organization. My agents can also use the application. As soon as they enter information in the application, it will automatically be entered in my Excel file. With PowerApps, creating mobile applications has never been so easy. PowerApps is designed to promote mobility and make field work easier. Using PowerApps helps you to save you a lot of time and money.",2018,N/A,[],['PowerApps'],[],243.0,use_case
45040,en,Teams - Collaborate as a team,44.0,"Hello everyone.Welcome to this online session called Collaborate with your Team in Teams.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start and in order to ensure it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instructions carefully.There are precisely three little instructions.The first one is: during this presentation, please do not take waiting calls or second calls.The music on hold will start playing and we'll no longer be able to hear one another.The second one: is on your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know,some of you may be are working in open space environments,so those are just cautionary measuresto avoid unpredictable or unwanted background noise.The third and last one is:remember to keep your computer screen active at all timesby wheeling the mouse every now and then.It's very important that you do not let your computer go into sleep modeas this would cause the interruption of the videoand you'd find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience is that you will have to repeat the login stepsall over again to get back in it.This is going to be a 45-minute session and our objectives areto experience the collaborative work with one simple and efficient tool.Then go to the MOOC platform to further your training.Before I jump to the outline of this presentation,I just want to stress that Microsoft Teams is a neat applicationthat allows you to create teams to achieve tasks.The tasks themselves can be broken down into subtasks,which is very useful if you are using project management software.You can allocate team members to each of these subtasksand the software allows you to provide the resources for the team memberssuch as documents, files, web links and so on.And for each task or subtask,the software is included in Microsoft Office 365 and is simply called Teams.To start it, of course, you will need to log onto your Microsoft Office portal and select Teams.Once opened, you can either work on it online or download it for offline working.Today's plan is to see how to create a team, to manage the team's files,to use the team's notebook, to organise and schedule meetingsand there will be a little Q and A at the end of this training session.And, of course, we'll see the rest of the study plan.Let's begin right now.I'm going to put Teams on the screen.First of all, we already saw on the Communicate with Teams training sessionhow to create a team.We are going to go back quickly on it just as a little reminder.Of course, I'm on my Teams.On the left, I have all of the different tabs.Just after it, I have all of my different teamsand, on the right, I have the viewing window.On the bottom left, I can join or create a team.Of course we find back the ability to create a team or to join a team with a code.Let's create one.I will build it from scratch.I will set it to private and then, for the name, I will just call it:Collaborate with Teams.Let's create it.Once again is going to take a few secondsand I will have to choose the different members of this team.Let's add some of them quickly.Apparently some of them don't want to be added.Let's go just with Oliver.Right here, we have our team with the first channel that's automatically created,as you can see on the left, the General channel.What do we want to see on Teams?Let's go on the different tabs directing to the channel.The first one is Conversation,we already saw that on the other training session.But we have Files.Let's click on Files.As you can see, right now is still setting up the file directory.Just after you created a new team,it will take a few minutes to set up everything in it.We are not going to wait for it to set it up the file directory.Let's just go on Alpha Project, right here in the General channel.The files tab once again.Wait a few seconds for it to load.And as you can see, we have no files in it.So we will see what we can do with it.On the top, we have different options.The first one, we have New, to create a new document.After it, we have Upload, to upload documents from my computer to Teams.Get a link, to share everything.Add a Cloud storage and Open SharePoint.So we are going to see each of them individually.Let's begin with New.In New, I can create a new folder, a new document, Word, Excel, PowerPoint.First of all, let's create a folder.Let's just call it: Test Folder 01.It would take a few seconds for it to appear on the screen because it's being created.As you can see, we have Test Folder 01 on the screen.Once again, you click on New, then Word document.Let's just call it Word 01.As you can see, there is no Word application or software that's open.It's just Word Online directly into Teams.I do not have to download anything to go online or whatever,I can access Word, Excel, PowerPoint directly in Teams.So right here, of course, I can add different information.As you can see, I had different information in it.And when it's done, as you can see, on the top, we have Saving.Automatically Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. are going to save everythingthat I had directly into the account that I just created.On the top right, I can start the conversation within this documentor I can close it.Let's start a conversation to see what it looks like.And on the right, a conversation panel just opened and I can add replies.So now it's a conversation feed and, of course,with all of the different participants in this Word document,because we can edit the document at the same time with the synchronisation.So everyone in the document will be able to see the conversationon the right and answer to it, but also we're going to see just after,we're going to see it directly into the conversation feed of the conversation tab.So let's close it.So we have the Test Folder and we have Word 01 right here.Let's continue.After it, I have Upload.I click on Upload, it will take a few seconds to open,and I have, as you can see, all of my files right here from my computerand I can click on one to add it into Teams.Get a link, we have a link from Teams or from the SharePoint,I can share both of them.And if I send them to someone who have access to the Teamsor if you set public Teams, let's say,they will be able to arrive directly into this file libraryand then they will be able to access the documents.Add a Cloud storage.On the Cloud storage I can add a SharePoint, a Dropbox,a Box, a ShareFile and a Google Drive.All of them, we are able to access them like SharePoint, as you can see here,and add a document in it.And open SharePoint, as you may have guessed,if I click on it, it will open SharePoint directly into the file library of the SharePoint,which is linked to the file library of the Teams, of course.Let's check one of the documents.I checked the Word document.As you can see, I have new options right here.First of all, I have Open.I can open it in Teams, open it in Word Onlineor open it in the Word software installed on my computer.I can get a link to share it.I can make it a tab, we'll see this just after.I can download it, of course, I can delete it, move it, copy it, rename itand I can open SharePoint to have the SharePoint file library once again.So let's make it a tab.As you can see on the top, I know I have Word 01 as a tab.If I click elsewhere, so I'm back in the file,and now I click on Word, it will be the Word document.And so, I will be able, on the top right, to edit it in Teams in Word Online.And of course, once again,all of the members of this Teams will be able to edit it whenever they want.And they're free to download it or open it in SharePoint.Let's go back to the conversation feed.On the bottom, we have the Word 01 documentand with it, I have the replies that I added just beforewhen I was in the conversation feed on the right.Right here, as you can see, I have ""Hello all"" that I added just before.It's possible, within the conversation tab and within the Files tab,to reply to each other, one being on the file, the other being directlyinto Teams into the conversation feed of the Alpha project team.So you'll be able to collaborate quickly directly on it.After it, we're going to talk about…Let's add a new tab.We are going to talk about OneNote, OneNote directly into Teams.I have to wait a bit for it to load.And as you can see right here,I can either choose an existing OneNote to add it directly into Teamsor I can create a new one.Let's create a new one and let's call it Alpha Project 01.And let's save it.Now it's setting up the OneNote tab so it will take a few seconds once again.We have right here: This notebook is empty. Click here to create a new section.I click it.I can enter a section name.Let's name it, for example, Meetings.I have my Meetings section.If I click on the little arrow,I can see right here Meetings on the Meetings sectionand I can create new pages in it.So let's say: ""Meeting from January"".If I click back on the little arrow, I have here Meeting from January.And I can add a page, Meeting from December, for example.So as you can see, on the little OneNote, I will be able to add different sections.So let's create one called Marketing.And here I will have the Meetings section, the Marketing sectionand, in each of them, I will have different pages.I can quickly organise my different notes being from important meetings,being just some little information, etc.Directly into the OneNote page, what can I do?Let's open the little tab on the top, and pin them.As you can see in the right, I can pin it to just have it on the top.I can write whenever and wherever I want.As you can see, we do not have any lines or margins …we just have the ability to write wherever we want.Of course, if I want to, I can edit the text, put it in bold,change the font, the size of the font,the colourand also I can add different, as you can see, bullets or numbering to do little lists.We have the same styles of possibilities as you can have on Word.But the most important thing right here is little tags.The tags, we have a lot of them.Some of them are just little icons.For example, Idea, right here, it’s just an icon.But if I put for example, To Do, let's just write ""Test"" again and again,I can check the one that are doneand leave unchecked the ones that I haven't done yet.So it's little to-do list to remember what you have to do.And we have the same thing on the bottom, as you can see,Discuss with, Discuss with, Schedule, Call back,To Do priority 1, priority 2, and Client request.But you can use them as you want, there is no mandatory usage for it.But as you can see, I can add little icons wherever I want.After it, I have the dictate option.If I want to, I can select, for example, let's say English US,and when it will be launched, activated,everything that I will be saying will be directly dictated by OneNote.So let's click on it.And now that the dictation is activated,everything that I'm saying out loud will be written directly into OneNote.I don't have to touch my keyboard or my mouse,I just have to talk out loud and then everything will be written directly on it.It would make you gain time, of course,but as you must have guessed, it may have some problems in it,maybe it didn't understand correctly what you said,so you'd have to check what you said and what is written, of course.We have the little text right here.I can now click on Insert.In insert, I can insert new pages, but also new sections.We already saw that.But I can also add little tables.The same table as we had on Word for example,and now I have a little table right here and I can add little information in it.It's just a simple table, nothing more.I can add pictures from my computer.I can use the camera button if I have a webcam, if I have my smartphone or my tablet.But I can also use the online picture functionality.Let's click on it,and here I have default searches.But I can also search for my own topic.Let's say, for example turtles,and I will find little images of turtles.I click on one, I click on Insert,and, of course, the little picture will be added directly into the OneNote.I can also do files print out.What is this?If I click on it, I have to select a Word or PDF document.Let's check if we have one of them.Unfortunately, I don't have a document that I can use for this presentation,but what it will do, it just prints the document on the screen.You won't be able to edit this document.You won't be able to add different information on it.It will be like a picture of the document on your OneNote, a printout.I can also attach files.I click on it, let's add the Admin Guide for example.I insert it,and in OneNote, I will have in a few seconds a little file on the OneNote,and by clicking on this file, everybody will be able to download it and open it.Like we used to do on email, we can do it on OneNote.And at any given moment, I can delete it.I have, of course, Add-in, I can add links.I can record the audio.Let's say, we are in a meeting,we want to record the audio around us, we click on it.I can add different symbols, why not emojis and stickers.After it, we have the draw tab.In the draw tab, I can use the pen tool to do just little drawings.I also have a highlighter to highlight the different important informationthat I have into my OneNote and, of course, in different colours,as you can see right here.Then lastly, we have a View tab for sub settings that we can use right here.Then we have Open in OneNote.As you may have guessed once again,is to open this document directly into OneNote software.We saw everything that we had to see about OneNote.Now we can talk about the meetings.So let's go back on the conversation tab, the meetings.Let's click on the Calendar tab on the left.On the calendar tab…Apparently Teams did not like me opening the calendar tab, so we will open it again.It would take a few seconds for Teams to open, as you can see it's searching up right here.The joy of the computer,sometimes the applications don't want to work properly,but you just close.As you can see, we are back on it.Let's wait for it to load for a second and then we go back into the training session.We are back on the calendar taband here we have our different meetings right here.As you can see, it's for Today on the top.I find my different meetingsand, if I want to, I'll be able to change events.As you can see, I have the agenda view right here.And I'm able to find all of the different meetings that I will have today, tomorrow, Wednesday, etc.On the right, I can accept a meeting to say: I will be here.I can use the Tentative button – ""maybe I will be here, maybe not, I'm not sure"" –or I can decline it – ""I won't be here"".If we go back on the Teams right here, the Teams tab,in the conversation feed once again, on the bottom,I will be able to use the Meet now button.I can add subjects to create what we call an instant meeting.An instant meeting, to be quick on it, let's say: ""Important Alpha Project""and I can click on Meet now.If I click on Meet now,I will begin an instant meeting with everybody in this team.So everybody in the Teams,and you will see in a few seconds right here, everybody on this team will see thisand they will be able to click on Join to join directly this instant meeting.But they won't get any notification or whatever, but it's only if they are on Teams.So we are going to talk about the meetings, what can we do during a meeting a bit later.Let's close it.Let's click on it once again,and here, instead of adding subjects or meeting now,we have on the bottom, as you can see, Camera.So if I had a camera, I will be able to turn it on or turn it off.Just if I want people to see me or not.Of course, when you create a meeting, you will have to choose the right channel for it.As we said on the Communicate with Teams training session,everybody in the Teams will have accessto the contents of all the different channels in it.So if you want to create a meeting in the Marketing channel right here,everybody also in the General channel and members of the Teams will be able to access these meetings.So be very careful about that.Let's launch our instant meeting.What can we do during a meeting or an instant meeting?Of course, I can turn on or turn off my camera or my microphone.But I will have the little sharing tray on the bottom.On the sharing tray, I will be able to share my desktop,my Screen 1, as you can see, or Screen 2, if I have different screens.I will be able to share also a window.So on the window, as you can see,I have all the different applications that are open.I can click on one to share it.And I can also share a PowerPoint.Lastly, on the right, I will be able to use the whiteboard.We have two different whiteboards, the Microsoft one and the Freehand one.Everything in it…And we'll talk a bit more about thatin the training session about the Teams meetings.We have a 45-minute training session about that,so we go into depth about all of this.Here is just a general presentation.On the top right, I will have the ability to take notes, to resume it quickly.I click on Take Notes.Let's wait for it to load for a few seconds.And right here, we have Notes, so I can give it a name.Let's call it: ""Meeting notes"".And here, I can add information, just write whatever.But as you can see, I can add information and I can edit the text,but also add pictures or tables if needed.After it, I can show a conversation because, as we did in the Files tab,the conversations on the right, I can do the exact same here.I can have a little conversation on the right with … that depends on the meeting.But this conversation will appear into the conversation feed of the channel.So be careful if you add sensitive information in it,everybody in the Teams will be able to access it and to view it.Then we can add people in the meeting.We see everybody in the meeting – currently only Amaury.The suggestions are the people in this team and I can invite people in here.But also, I can copy as they join and for to send them to some people.Then the setting panels to change your devices;speakers, microphone and the camera, if I want one.So I can turn on or turn off the private viewingthat allows the participants to move through shared presentation on their own.I have to change here if I want to.We quickly saw little things about the Meetings possibilities in Teams.Lastly, on the left we have the Files tab, on the far left.In the Files tab, I will find all of my recent files,I will find all of the files that are in different Teams,so let's wait for it for a second.So right here, we have, as you can see, the little files once againand, on the right, I have the locations.The files that are downloaded recently,and I can add different Cloud storage, OneDrive,but also I can Box, Dropbox, etc., as we saw before.And we will find them back in here in the Cloud storage.The three little dots are for different applications.What are those applications?If you go on the Teams and you want to add a new tab,right here we will find all of the different applicationsthat we have access to  – and we have a lot of them, of course.Let's go back on our PowerPoint slide.So what did we see today?To begin with, we can join or create a team,as we saw in the Communicate training session.I can manage the team files by going into the Teams.In the different channels, I will have Files.And in Files, I will find different files that I can use.For the Teams notebook,I will find little notebooks that all of the coworkers have access toand will be able to edit it.To organise and schedule meetingswe have a little button, on the bottom left into the Meetings' tab,Schedule a meeting with your staff.We didn't see it today before.As I said, we have a training session specifically about that,so we'll talk more about that in it.And, of course, we saw the different informationfor the future meetings, if we accept, tentative or decline.If you have any question, do not hesitate.I'm here to answer them all.If you do not have any questions,because this presentation has come to an end,I would push it to the part where I'll show you how the MOOC platform works.I will use my personal account and dashboard on it for now,because you already all know about this digital platform.We already saw it a few times.Just remember the little calendar that you can use on the topto find all of the different training sessions to comeand also different tabs.There's the number of courses you're taking, the learning courses,training sessions and, of course, number of shares.And do not forget about, as you can see right here,Most Consulted, Recommended for you, and Most Recent.All of those training sessions that are into your dashboard,you will find them directly in it.And for the Recommended for you, the more you follow training sessions,the more the algorithm for it will be interestingand so you will find the best training sessions for you.Thank you all for participating to this online session.It's been a pleasure exchanging with you.Do enjoy our platform and get the most out of itand, most of all, I bid you all a pleasant day.Goodbye.",2018,N/A,[],[],[],2041.0,webcast
45041,en,Teams - Communicate as a team,21.0,"Hello everyone.Welcome to this online session called Communicate with Your Team in Teams.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start, and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instruction carefully.There are precisely three of them.The first one: During this presentation, please do not take a call waiting or a second call.The music on hold will start playing and we no longer be able to hear one another.The second one is: On your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may be working in open space environments,so those are just cautionary measures to avoid unpredictable or

go into sleep modeas this will cause interruption of the videoand you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeatthe log in step all over again to get back in.So this is going to be a 45-minute session and our objectives areto experience the collaborative work with one simple and efficient tool.Then go to the MOOC platform to further your training.But before I jump into the outline of this presentation,I just want to stress that Microsoft Teams is a neat application thatallows you to create teams to achieve tasks.The tasks themselves can be broken down into subtasks,which is very useful if you are using project management software.You can allocate team members to each of the subtasksand the software allows you to provide resources for the team memberssuch as documents, files, web links and so on.And for each task or subtask, this software is includedin Microsoft Office 365 and is simply called Teams.To get started, of course, you would need to log onto your Microsoft Office portal and select Teams.Once opened, you can either work it online or download it for offline working.So today's plan is to see how to, first of all, create a team or to add a channel,how to manage your own profile, how to follow your team activity,how to use the instant messaging.And after that, we will also go over the most important things to remember.I can then answer any question you may haveat the very end with the rest of the study plan as well.So let's put Teams directly on the screen.So we are here on Teams.To begin with, we have on the left the different tabs available to do different things.Then we have our different teams.We have the channels just under it.And on the right, we have the viewing window.What do we want to do to begin with?Well, we want to create a team.I want my colleagues to be in specific teams to do specific tasks.So on the bottom left, let's click on Join or create a team.We have many more possibilities right here.First of all, we have Create a team.That's what we want to do right here.But let's wait a few seconds before going into it.Then we have Join a team with a code.Well, when you are part of a team, you can, if you want, generate a code.This code, you can send it to anyone,and this person right here would be able to enter the code,click in Join team, and he will join your team as a guest.He will be able to see everything, but it will be only a guest.Then for Alpha and for MOOC Microsoft 365 right here,we have what we call public teams.Those public teams, everybody in the company is able to join them.But of course, they just have to go in here, click on Join teamand there will be a member of your team.Let's click on Create a team.We have two possibilities right here.First of all, Build a team from scratch.We just want to create our own team from the base.But we also have Create from an existing Office 365 group or team.You may already know this, but when you create a SharePoint,automatically, you will create an Outlook group, but also a planner, for example.Same thing for the Outlook group.You create it, you create a SharePoint, you create a planner, etc.When you create a team, you will create SharePoint,an Outlook group and a planner.So let's say, you already have a SharePoint called Communication.If you create a new team, also called a Communication,well, you will have two SharePoints.Each of them named Communication.But if you want to link those, both the SharePoint and the team,well, you can create as a team from an existing Office 365 group,and you will link it automatically to the SharePoint that you want.And so, they will share documents, etc.,and you won't have multiple occurrences of the same SharePoint, etc.So let's build a team from scratch.We can set it to private or public.Let's click on Private.Let's give it a name.We'll just call it Teams Communicate.Then I can add a little description:This Team is only for communication purposes.Let's click on Create.It could take a few seconds to create a team.As you can see, it's a thing I did, a nice work of creating it,and then I can add people in it.Let's add for example Oliver, maybe also Lisa and Pierre.I click on Add and, as you can see, that is added.On the right, I have Members.We have a little arrow pointing to the bottom.If I click on it, I can select if each of its members are well members or owners.What's the difference?Well, by creating a team, I am its owner.And I can have multiple owners for a team,which means that Pierre, for example, if I put him as an owner, will be able to changeall of the different settings as well into the teams like if he was the creator of it.And of course, I can add multiple members.But if I put them as only members and not owners,they will only be able to see the commands, to edit them, etc.,but they wouldn't be able to, for example, delete a team.Let's click on Close,and automatically I'm on my team page, Teams Communicate, in the first channel.This channel is named General.What is the difference between a team and a channel?When you create a team, you add members in it.So you'll have, let's say, 10 members.When you create a channel, it's just, let's say, another room for your members to go into.So we'll have General, Marketing, Accounting, etc.Every member in a team is able to access all of the different channels,which means, let's say, you are on Teams Communicate right here.You have, as I said, the Marketing channel and the Accounting channel.Everybody from Accounting will be able to go to Marketingand everybody in Marketing to Accounting.You can't close off certain channel to certain people.It's either everybody can access all of the channels or nobody can access them.So it's mandatory to have all of the different members in all of the different channels.So be careful if you have important or sensitive documents in a channel,everybody in this team is able to access them.If I click on the three little dots on the right of Teams Communicate, right here,I can remove it from my Favourites.As you can see, it's the Favourites folder right here,and, under it, I have More, for all the different teams,I can remove it if you go directly to More.I can manage it, we'll do it later.Add a channel.I click on it.I select a channel, let's say, Marketing.A little description if I want,and I can automatically favourite this channel for the whole team.What does it mean?For the whole team, this channel will appear on the left, right here,just under General, but on top of everything else.And every time I add a channel to the favourites,it will go, let's say we have General and Marketing and Accounting, etc.,so it will go on top every time, but every time under General.General will always be the top one.Let's click on Add.I have Marketing on our channel.Let's go back to the three little dots.I can add members, I can leave the team, but be careful.I can only leave the team if I'm not the only owner.If I'm the only owner, I won't be able to leave it,because every team needs an owner.I can edit it.So if I click on it, I can choose the team name, description or privacy.I can get a link to share it and, of course, I can delete it.If I manage it, let's go see it quickly.I am able to see the different owners, members and guests.And as an owner, I can see that Oliver is no longer an owner,because I am the creator of the team.Oliver, as an owner, wasn't able to say that I am only a member, because I created this team.I can see the pending request if someone wants to join the team,the different channels existing, and I can also add some on top right,and see the different deleted channels that I have.I can go into Settings.We are not going to see everything in Settingsbecause, as you can see, we have a lot of possibilities, but some important things.Let's say, Team code, to generate a team code, of course,and also the Guest permissions.Are they allowed to create or update channels?And are they allowed to delete channels?Then we have Apps, to see the different applications that I can addand, we'll see this later, on the different tabs in the different channels.So now let's go into a channel, General channel.What do we have here?To begin with, we have, on the bottom, right here, the ability to start a conversation.What can I do more?Well, first of all, I can change the format.Put it in bold, italic, underline it, change the colours,add bulleted lists or even numbered lists, quote, link and even snip it.Well, after it, I can also attach files.If I click on it, oh no, as you can see, it was setting it up.I can choose from my recent files.I can browse my teams and channelsto add files from different teams, different channels.I can access the team by OneDriveand also I can directly upload it from my computer.Then I can add emojis, of course, little gifs – those are the little videos that repeat themselves and we have a sort of humour to it.And if you want to consult something, let’s say Marketing,we will have gifs related to marketing.We have little stickers.So once again, little fun things to add.Then we have the Meet now possibility.The Meet now options, we are not going to see them here,because we have a specific training session dedicated to it.So we're not going to talk about it here.Then we have Places, to add different locations to the team,and the three little dots to use some applications.Then we have the conversation feed right hereand, at the top, we have different tabs; Conversion, Files and Wiki.We are going to go back on it in a few seconds.Let's check some settings into the channels.Let's say, Marketing.The three little dots, I can remove it from my favourites.I can get an email address, which means that I can send emailsto this email address and my mail will be readable directly from the conversation feed.I can get a link to the channel to share it, I can edit it,change the names, description of the favourites.I can add some connectors and even delete it, of course.And I can follow it.What does it mean?What's the difference between Favourite and Following?When you put a team in favourite, this channel or this team will be on top,which means that it would be an easy and quick access.But if I follow it, it may not be an easy and quick accessbecause it may not be in favourites, but we will receive notifications.Someone posting a message, someone answers a message,someone likes a message or someone adds files,I will receive notifications.So I will always be able to say if there are new things or not on the team.So Favourite is a quick access, Following is to have notificationsabout everything that is happening on the team right now.So now we're going to talk about the different tab on the top.Conversation, I think it's quite easy: it's a conversation feed.Files,right here you're going to find all of the different files that we can add to our teams.We are not going to talk about the Files tab here becausethe training session Collaborate with Teams talks about it a lot more, a lot further.Then we have the Wiki.The Wiki is like a little notebook, directly integrated to the team.So let's wait for a little bit to load.I can add a page name, so we will just call it Page Test 01.Then I can add sections, Section 01, once again.And then I can add pages.So I can add information right here.Then I click on the little plus to add a new section,Section 02, and once again I can add information.I can edit the format, of course, change the paragraphs,even add images or tables.So while it's a little and quick notebook, not as good as OneNote,but for some little information, it's quite good.So after it, we have, as you can see, the little plus button.The plus button, we have, as you can see, a lot of applications right here.Some of them are well-known: Excel, OneNote, PDF.We have a SharePoint, PowerPoint…We know all of them.But we also have a lot more applications.All of them are directly integrated to Teams.And so, I can click on Trello and I can add Trello to my Teams.For now, let's just do it with, let's say for example, a Planner.Let's click on Planner.So we have to wait for a little bit to load, of course.And here, I can easily create a new plan, a new planner,or I can use an existing planner.Once again, I don't want to have the planner that is named Marketingand then create a new one Marketing on Teams to have two marketing planners.It's useless.So I can use an existing plan for this.Let's create a new one.Let's name it, well, Marketing, of course, because we don't have one for now.I have a check of all box right here posted to the channel about this tab.If I leave it checked, in the conversation feed,there will be a conversation about this tab being added.I can check it.Well, sorry, there will be no conversation about it.Let's save it.While we're waiting for it to load, let's go back quickly into the conversation taband, as you can see, that conversation has begun.We have the little Planner logo right here and Marketing here.By clicking on it, I will access the planner right here.As on any other planner, I have the same possibilities.I can add tasks, assign the tasks to members, set a due dateand, of course, add information and pictures, etc.It’s a planner like the online planner that we all know,but it's directly integrated into Teams.You won't have to open different applications,different software, different web pages, no,you just need Teams to do everything that you wantwith your colleagues, with your co-workers.Let's see what we can add more on it.Plus button once again.I can add a SharePoint.Let's wait for it once again.I can either use an existing SharePoint.For now we have no list.So the SharePoint is linked directly, when I created the Teams.And so, if I add the different pages, different lists to the SharePoint,I will find them back right here by clicking on SharePoint.Let's click on News, for example, let's save it.And the News compartment from our SharePoint, there is nothing herebut you guessed it, if there was something, we would find it.But the pages from a SharePoint, I can add it directly into the Teams once again.As you may have guessed, we can add a lot of different tabs,a lot of different applications directly into Teams.And also, just a little reminder, three little dots, we have the Connectors.Let's see those Connectors quickly.In the Connectors, I have Forms, Azure, RSS, Twitter,Trello, Yammer, etc.What are the Connectors?Well, let's use Twitter as an example.On Twitter, we send and we receive tweets.I don't want to go every day to my company Twitter pageto see all of the new tweets, etc.I can connect it to my Teams.And so, every new tweet will appear directly into the conversation feed.Once again, no need to use multiple applications, multiple web pages,everything is on Teams.Of course, I'm not going to make an example here because I thinkyou understand what's the use here.So now, let's talk a bit about our profile.How can we manage it?On the top right, you have your picture.If we click on it, to begin with, we have Change picture, right here.We click on Change picture, I can upload a new one or remove the picture.For now, this demonstration account has a perfect picture,let's not touch it.Then we have the Availability status.If you used to use Skype, you all know what is the availability status.But for the one who don't know, we have different statues on Teams.Available, I think it's pretty clear, we are available.You can send messages, you can call, everything's okay.Busy, once again, you can send messages, receive messages,take calls, receive calls, etc.But you are busy, which means that maybe you won't be able to answerbecause you are working.Maybe someone is going to send you a message.If you don't answer them, they are going to see the little Busy dot,""ah, yeah, he's busy, that's why he is not answering"".Do not disturb, I would go back in a few seconds.We have: Be right back, and Appear away.I think it's clear once again, I'm not on my computer for now.So there is a big chance that I won't answer your call, your message, etc.But I have still a chance, I guess.Then we have Do not disturb.Do not disturb, if you use it,people will still be able to send you messages, to call you,but you won't receive any notification.You won't receive any audio notification, you won't receive any visual notificationbecause you are in Do not disturb, you don't want to be disturbed.They still can try it, but you won't receive them.Let's go back on Available.Then we'll check Saved, right here.The Saved button is to see the different conversations that we have saved.How to save a conversation? Well, it's quite simple.We have a conversation right here being from me or from someone else.On the right, I have, right here, the little flag.I click on it to save the message.As you can see, saved.If I click on the Saved button,I will find back all of the different conversations that I saved.And so I can reread them whenever I want.Then we have the Settings.So let's check a bit the Settings.The Settings, once again, I won't go into all of thembecause there was a lot of settings in Teams,but you can change some general settings,Auto-start the application,On close, keep the application running,change the language, etc.And we have a lot of them.Of course, you can change the zoom,see the keyboard shortcuts about different information,check for updates, download the mobile app and sign out.I think everything is clear on it.Let's go now on the top left in Activity.In Activity, we have, to begin with, Feed.Feed will be all of the new notifications that are related to you.I guess someone liked a message,someone posted something in the channel that you are following.You will see every new notification on you.You missed a message, you missed a call, it would be in the notification.But if I click on Feed, I will have My Activity.In My Activity, you will find everything that you did.And, as you can see, it will not go back from hundred years,but you will find different things you did a few weeks before.As you can see, it's today, the different tabs.And we also have, on the bottom, a post I did a week away.So you would find back everything that you did.If you're a member of, let's say, 20 different teams,you don't want to write everything.""Today in the Marketing teams, I got something at X hour"", etc. Well, no.You go in My Activity,you will find back every information, everything that you've posted.It's easier for you to find back a conversation that is importantbecause you'll find the first message that you sent.And of course, on the top right, you can filter it.You can unread, mention, reply, following, etc.to make it easier to find a different notification if you have a lot of them, of course.Lastly, we want to talk about the instant messaging, the chat.By clicking on the Chat tab,I will be able to find back the group conversation, the one-to-one conversationand some suggested contacts for conversation.By clicking on the Contact tab,I will find all of my different contacts with such friend groups.As you can see, we have Favourites, Direction, (inaudible), etc.Let's click on the top right here.We have New chat.Let's create a new chat and let's send it to Oliver.So I can send a message to Oliver.""Hi Oliver.""I click on Enter and then my message is sent.As we did on the conversation feed before,I can change the format, send files, emojis, gif, stickersand I can also schedule meetings directly from my instant messaging.But I'm not going to talk about it here.I can add places and the three little dots to use different applications.Of course, I have different tabs on the top.The Files tab, to find all of the files that I've shared with Oliver.I have Organisation.We have not here, but it's what you see the organisation of the company.Activity, to see Oliver's activities on my different teams.We are part of the same teams, not all of them, but a few of them.I would be able to see what he did into those teams because I'm a part of it too.So it's a quick way to find different information as well.The little Plus button to add a tab.As you can see, we do not have a lot of tabs like we used to doon the specific teams or channels, but we still have a lot of them:Excel, OneNote, PDF, Power BI, PowerPoint, etc.And also, we have the Freehand, Freehand by Invision.Freehand, it’s a whiteboard, like we used to have on the Skype for example,a bit better, I want to say,but you can add the Freehand directly in a tab in a conversation,so you won't have to save every whiteboard that you use every time you are in a conversation.No, it will be automatically saved in a tab in the conversationthat you can find back whenever you want.On the top right, I can start a video conversation if I have a camera,an audio call, of course.On the far right, we can add people to this conversation.Let's add Lisa, for example.Now it's a group conversation.And lastly, I can share my screen if I click on it.As you can see, I have my different screens, my different windows.I can choose the one that I want to share, as simply as that.Let's go back on our PowerPoint.So to begin with, we had an issue.I wanted to access a customised workspace centralising a number of toolswhere I can experience collaborating working as well.We resolved that.In Teams, we can create a team to communicateand collaborate with the same team members.And, of course, I can add team members and simply communicate with our co-workers.I was looking for a turnkey solution to facilitate the communicationand collaboration within my team.Under the created team, I can directly add a channel.A channel is like a chat room, as we said, with a specific themethat you create for your team, events, services, miscellaneous.You can create any topic that you want.Your need, you needed a team to know when to reach you.So when the team members can see you are available or not.Because you are part of the team,the members will need to consult you from time to time on a particular issue.It's useful and necessary to have access to the availability status indicator.And as we saw, we have: Available, Busy, Do not disturb,Appear away or Away from computer.I needed to identify experts and obtain opinions from a group of people.Based on the idea that you can always view your activity history,you can follow the team activity on the navigation bar as well.Always stay abreast on your team's activity by placing yourself in the centre of the activity.You collaborate and you put yourself in a field of expertise identified by your staff.You wanted to ask the entire team a questionand simply consult their individual replieswithout mixing that information with your personal messages, of course.In Teams, you can organise your chats and calls by groups or on one to one, if you want.To exchange with all or part of the team, the chat box was intendedto respond to all your need and functions.The most important things to remember,Teams allows the creation of a collaborative space for targeted employees.Teams centralise all the necessary tools to teamwork.You can also customise your space.By adjusting your profile and availability status indicator,you can be reached at the right time.Quickly you can get updates on the latest information and chatsand you can use the chat tools to contact your company's key actors, the experts, when needed.If anyone has any question about the material presented just now,I would be happy to answer them.If no one has any question, we proceed to the next section.So, of course, we are going to talk about the MOOC platform.Everybody in here knows the MOOC platform because we had a few sessions together.So we already talked about that.Just remember, of course, on the MOOC training platform,you have different tabs: Learning paths, Courses,Tutorials, and Use Case Scenarios, and, of course, the calendar.The calendar to find depending on the day or data availablethe different training session that we have at this moment.You go for example on Tuesday, and on Tuesday, we have this session or that session.So it's easier for you to find the right time to do training session.And also do not forget about the Most Consulted, Recommended for you,and Most Recent training session to find what is the most interesting training sessions.For the Recommended for you tab, the more training sessions you do,the best easy algorithm about it.So the more you do training sessions,the more we can recommend for you training sessions,we will be really recommended for you and for what you like.Finally, I will thank you all for participating to this online session.It’s been a pleasure exchanging with you.Do enjoy your platform and get the most out of itand, most of all, I bid you all a pleasant day.",2018,N/A,[],[],[],2168.0,webcast

First of all, what is Microsoft Booking? Then, how to manage your company's information.So we will see how to add your company's info, how to add and manage your employees, how to add your services, how to publish your booking page, how to manage your reservation's calendar and how to supervise your activity. We will also see from the customer's viewThe simple alternative to the usual reservation and also how to manage your reservation everywhere.The objectives today are to identify how to use Microsoft Bookings and also to see what the benefits of this application are.So to begin with, what is Bookings? Without Bookings, we know that making a reservation via a phone call is tedious. We also know that managing our staff info can be complicated. The schedule may be a mess.We have missed reservations. We do not know how to remember our reservations. But also managing your stuff can be difficult. So we will see with Bookings how to manage your company.To manage our company, we need to add our company's infos, to manage our employees, to add services, to publish our booking page, to manage the reservation's calendar and to supervise our activity. All of this can be possible with Bookings. I'm going to put Booking on the screen.To begin with Bookings, just after clicking on the Office 365 portal, it says ""Tell us about your business"". First of all, we have to select a name. We will just call it ""Company 01"". Then the business type.Maybe, we sell guided tours across the city. Then we click on Continue.Now it will create a company page on Bookings. We just have to wait a few seconds.Of course, it can take a few seconds. After, it will be able, as we saw previously on the PowerPoint, to add the different information that we need for the customer to make their reservations better, and we will also be able to manage our staff.To put their information and their availability: When are our employees available and when can we put  tasks for them? So we are now on the Company 01 page on Bookings. To begin with, let's go on the left.We have different tabs: Business information on the bottom left. Let's click on this.Right here, we have a lot of information to add. The business name: ""Company 01"", no problem with this. The business address: Let's say, Street of Shops.The business phone: we can put our business phone quickly.And also ""Send customer replies to"". Here, we will have to put a professional email address. All of the replies from the customers will go directly to this address. Let's put a false email address.The website URL, if we have one. The privacy policy URL and the terms and conditions as well. The business type: We already added the info. And the currency that will be used on the booking page. So we have a lot of different currencies.Let's keep the dollar.The business logo: Let's click on Change. We have Upload new logo, on the right.I can click on the one I want for the booking logo. If I need to crop the logo, I can add colors to the background if I don't want to crop it, maybe red, etc. Here it's the perfect size, but just in case.Then I click on Save. The logo will appear on the left. On the right, we have to add the business hours. It begins on Sunday to Saturday. Sunday and Saturday are closed by default, but if you want we can open those different dates.After that, we have all the days of the week from 8 AM to 5 PM. I can change this for every day.I can say that maybe on Mondays we do not work. I click on the little cross Remove this time slot. But let's say on Saturdays we work from 8 AM to 4 PM.When everything is OK, we can click on the top left on Save to save the different information about our business.So when it is saved, we can go on the left on the Staff tab. The only staff member to be available will be me, the creator of this Bookings page. But I can click on Add staff.To begin with, I will choose the color for the staff member, let's say orange. His initials, TD. I can add someone, I can just put some letters and I will find people, let's say Amaury.As you can see, I put it TD at first. I choose Amaury and then the initials change automatically. His email address, his phone number if I want to, and if he is a viewer, an administrator or a guest. Administrators can edit all settings, add and remove staffand create, edit and delete bookings. Viewers can see all the bookings on the calendar but they can't edit or delete them. Guests can be assigned to bookings but they can't open the booking mailbox.Let's say he is a viewer because he can access the calendar. He can't edit or delete anything but he has access to it.I can choose if I want to send him an email notification for the different information that will be right here.On the right, I have his availability. Events on Office 365 calendar affect availability. So will the events on his own calendar affect his availability on Bookings? Yes, or no, if I want to check it or not.Do I use the business hours for his availability? Yes or no. If I uncheck it, I can just change his availability. Let's say on Tuesdays, he does not work, but from Wednesday to Saturday he works the whole day, every time.On Saturdays, he will work after the closing time. Now I can click on Save on the top left.Let's do another one quickly to have some members in the staff,. Let's add Pierre this time. Once again, the color, phone number, viewer, email notification, does events affect his availability, and do I use the business hours. Well, no, I will change some hours quickly.Let's click on Save once again. Now we have staff members, so I can go on the left, I will have a few more possibilities. To begin with let's go to Services.What can I do for customers? Let's add a service.The service name: Let's say ""Guided tour (Short)"".Description : ""The shortest guided tout available"".The location: I put ""Street"" and as you can see we have different streets.The duration: Days, hours and minutes. Maybe it's for 2 hours. Do we have a buffer time? The buffer time is, maybe, we have 15 minutes before and after this time that people can't book because we have to make some preparation, etc.The price: Fixed price, starting at something, hourly price, free, price varies, call us to know, price is not set. Let's say fixed price at $60. Then the notes, which are internal only, if you need internal notes for this.Then we have the Custom fields. If we click on Modify, we can see the customer email, phone number, address and notes. Are they required or not? I can click on the one I want, maybe the phone number is required, maybe not.I can add a question on the top, either text question or dropdown question. Let's say, dropdown question: ""Will you be more than 5 people?""Then we put ""Yes"" or ""No"" and we save. We can say if it is required or not. Let's click on OK.Now we can add a reminder. The default reminder is one day before, but I can add an email reminder,let's say one hour to the customer, the staff or the attendees.""Do not forget the guided tour in 1 hour.""Then we have the publishing options: Show this service on the booking page. Yes, I want to. And the online scheduling options. We can use the default scheduling policy or we can change it. Sow available times in increments of 30 minutes or more.The minimum lead time for booking cancellation in hours, 24 hours for example. And the maximum lead time, so maximum number of days in advance that a booking can be made. Do I want an email notification about this? For the business, not for the customer.And do we allow the customers to choose a specific staff member for their guided tour. Let's click on Save. Let's create another one quickly. Service name: ""Guided tour (long)"".Location, hours, let's say 5 hours.The price: Fixed price, the custom fields, etc. When everything is done, I can click on Save. Now we have 2 services available for the customers.On the left, we have the Customers tab. We will find all the different customers that already booked things with us or I can create new customers myself. First name, last name, email, display as something,phone, instant messaging, work phone, address, other information or not. If a customer books something on this page, they will automatically appear in this Customers tab.Then we have the Booking page. For now, it is not published. Customer data usage consent: Show a personal data collection and usage consent toggle along with a message on my booking page? Yes or no. The scheduling policy: The time increments, etc.The email notifications for the business; and do we allow customers to choose a specific staff member? On the right, I can customize my page: The color theme, let's say orange or green because its Bookings, do we display our logo?And if I want to change some region settings. I can now save and publish this page. I can now share it. So I can copy the link and put it on Facebook, Twitter, and send it by mail. Let's copy it and we will open it after.The calendar tab. For now there is nothing but it's the Office 365 calendar for everybody, but for the company there is nothing for now. On the homepage, we have some possibilities: Customize our booking page, set our business hours, create our first booking...Things that I've already done, but these are quick access to it. We also have the booking activities on 30 days: The bookings made, the estimated revenue and the customers that are booked right now.Let's open the link I copied a few seconds ago. I open it on the side and I will put it on the screen in a few seconds.Here is what customers will see.We have the initial consult which was the test service that was on the booking page. It's nothing but we have the guided tour (long or short). Let's click on ""short"" to begin with.Then we have to select the time. The calendar is loading. Let's say I want it for Tuesday, 26. I click on it, and I want it at 1:00 PM, and because I authorized it,as a customer I can choose the staff member that I want on this time. Maybe I want Oliver Lodge to be the tour guide.After it, I have to add my details: The name, Laurent, my email address, my phone number, my real address and if I have any special requests.So let's just add some ""test test test"" to see what it will look like. We also have Provide additional information. ""Will you be more than 5 people?"" Yes, or no. I click on ""yes"" and then I click on Book.I forgot to select time and the phone number quickly. Then I can click on Book.It will take a few seconds for the booking to be made, but as you can guess just after it, the information will go to the email address of the business I put on my booking page. So I will receive notification for the booking and the information of this customer.As you can see, you will get a confirmation message in email shortly. It's a fake email address so I won't receive it. I'm back on this page, I can reschedule, cancel booking or make a new booking. If I click on New booking and then Guided tour (long),I can select the date, the time and the staff member. But because I didn't add the ""Will you be more than 5 people?"" object, it is not here, but I can still book the long guided tour.Then I will have the information about this customer. I will take a few minutes, but it will appear at one moment or another. Maybe if we go on the 26 to check,as you can see ""Oliver Lodge, guided tour (short) with Laurent.It appears right here. In the Customers tab, I have Laurent with all his information. Back to our PowerPoint, we saw that we had to add our company's information: Information, logo, opening hours.We had to save our employees details, to choose on employees availability, the services: The length, the price, the staff affectation and the final phase was to connect our reservation page to our Facebook,to manage notifications, to personalize our theme, and to publish it. I will find reservations in the calendar. So we receive booking confirmations by email directly in our agenda and I can add reservations manually in the calendar.I can also add holidays or days off and I can follow my activity. From the customer's view, I can enjoy a quick and simple alternative to the usual reservation: Easy access via Internet to select the services,choose the date, do you want a specific employee? What time would you like?And the customer's info, the schedule confirmation by email and the reminder by email.I can also follow my activities on my smartphone and I can manage my company without a sweat.Now we will check the training portal and if you have any questions, we will see about it. On the training portal, you will find the Learning Paths which are different training sessions in the same context.Let's say we want to know more about Outlook. I will find the different learning paths about Outlook. Inside, I will have different courses that talk about Outlook.In Courses, I will find different courses that I can register to. Let's say I want to know more about Bookings.I click on it, and on the right, if there is any available session I will find them and I will be able to click on Register to be on this training session. The Tutorials are very short videos from 50 seconds to 5 minutes. You have a lot of them.You want to know more about Planner, we have 7 videos about Planner and how to use it. 2 minutes, nearly 3 minutes, 1 minute, etc. It is very short and it goes directly to the goals that you want you want.You want to know more about creating compartments to organize tasks, those videos will not talk about anything else than what's in the title. The Use Case Scenarios, like the Tutorials, are very short videos not about a specific software but about a subject.The first one: ""Organize your next team meeting"". We are not talking about any software here but the videos will talk about the different software you can use to organize you next team meeting. Finally, we have on the top right if you click on your name, My dashboard.In the dashboard you find all the information about yourself on the training sessions: The different Courses you have taken, the Learning Paths, the training Sessions in which you are registered and if you have shared anything. Here in the ""You are registered to x Session"",you will find today's training session about Bookings. After this session, you will be able to go in this section and to evaluate this session. It's not mandatory but if you answer this little evaluationyou can say everything about this course, good things, not-so-good things, anything you want. It is for us to be better in what are we do. Everything you say will be taken into consideration.If you have any questions, I'm listening. Tell me if you want to know more about Bookings? Do you have any questions? No I think that's pretty straightforward, the only question I have would be: You said the video was going to be recorded, have we got an email copy about that?Not for now, you will not receive an email with it, but you will find it on the MOOC on the Bookings Training Session section. You'll find those videos on the bottom right, but not now.We have a little time to process it before it. If everything is good for you, I thank you for being here today and for your participation.Make the best use of what you have learned. I hope to see you on another training session and have a good day.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],1558.0,webcast
70385,en,Skype VS Teams,49.0,"Hello, everyone. I'm Thomas and welcome to this webinar about Skype VS Teams. So let's begin right now.Before we begin, as you may have noticed your microphones are muted in order not to have any background noise on this webinar. Also remember to stay active on your computer or else your computer will go stand-by mode and you'd be disconnected from the session.Today we have 30 minutes. So why Teams has the same possibilities as Skype. Also, the benefits of using Teams.Then we will be comparing the audio, video and meeting functionalities.How to make the transition from Skype to Teams easier and in the end a little conclusion. The goals for today are to identify the similarities and differences between those two softwares and how to be prepared for the transition from Skype to Teams.So we have Skype and we have Teams. What are Skype and Teams? Why does Teams have the same functionalities as Skype? What will happen to Skype?And the updates and evolutions possible. To begin with, what are Skype and Teams. Skype is a communication chat, audio and video call online meeting application. Teams is more is a more compressive tool, which was created when Microsoftwanted to simplify the access to the Office 365 functionalities that where richer every day.So the idea is to give to the user an application in which it will be possible to choose apps and to centralize the messages and documents. Why does Teams have the same functionalities as Skype?So still in the idea of simplification, Teams will have Skype's functionalities.Users will have a unique space for conversations, contacts, files and will be able to work at maximum capacity. What will happen to Skype? The different announcements about Skype are a bit alarmist. Skype will not disappear in a matter of days. You don't after users that Skype will disappear.Outside of Office 365, Microsoft now gives a Skype server 2019 for companies that want Skype on promise with dedicated servers.Updates and evolutions? With the office 365 version, there won't be any maintenance or updates and all the efforts will now go to Teams.Even if Teams is not yet seen as reliable or innovative, it will soon be. As a proof, the fact that certain functions now exist in Teams and not in Skype. For example, blurred backgrounds on live calls.So on Skype and Teams, what are the differences? On Skype and on Teams, we have the instant messaging, the availability status indicator, the audio and video call, the online meeting, the meeting planification, the SIP Telephonyand the large scale meetings. But on Teams, we will have a bit more things. So we will have a collaborative space, the discussion channels, the documented storage, the integrated calendar, the application launcherand the ability to edit and co-edit documents.So, we have the communication part in which Skype is already doing a good job for which Teams has the same possibilities. And we will have the collaboration part in which Teams is better than Skype because it has more possibilities, more functionalities.The benefits of using Teams: we have the exchange between teams, the collaborative tools,the Office 365 applications' integration, the third-party applications' integration,the workspace personalization,the access to different tenants and also a single login to all of our tools and documents.I can see that there are a lot of people that don't have any sound. If anyone has sound can you tell me in the chat box on the top of the screen or else we will continue the training session.So I can see that a lot of people have sound, so just some people have problems, so we will go on and they will have the little recording of the streaming session. So it will be OK. So now we are going to compare Skype and Teams.So the things that are already on Skype, we will see them directly on Teams. I'm going to put Teams on the screen.So we are right here on Teams. I will go on the Teams tab on the left so we will begin freshly direction Teams.Just the time for it to load and we will see it in a few seconds.So we have the Teams tab. It is where the collaborative work is going to happen, but also the communication. We want to know here what are the differences on functionalities that are the same on Skype and Teams.We are going to see it right now by clicking on the left on the chat tab. The chat tab is going to be for the instant messaging. So to begin with, as you can see on the top, we have two sorts of tabs. We have the recent tab with all recent the conversations.and with the three little dots, I can add a contact to this group. So I can click on it, I choose someone which I have as a contact, like Amaury. I click on ""add"" and then, as you can see, Amaury is now in my web contacts. But alsosome things that I can do: at the bottom, you can see ""create a new contact group"".So I choose a name, let's say ""webinar group"".I click on ""create"".And now I have, as you can see on the left, right here, webinar group. Once again, I can click on ""options"", ""add a contact to this group"". I choose someone an I can add him directly into this group and, of course, like it's on Skype. I have my different groups, my different people. I cantalk to all of them, like you used to do on Skype. Let's go on, on the instant messaging. What can we do in here?Let's go with Pierre. As you may know, I can send simple message. Once again, I'm going to say ""hello"" to Pierre.But on the bottom I will have a few more possibilities than on Skype.To begin with, I have the possibility to format my text. I can put it in bold, in italics, underline it. But a few more possibilities to highlight, change the font color, the font size, etc. Like a little text paragraph.Of course I can attach different documents from my OneDrive or even uploaded from my computer like I used to do before. As you know, I have the little emojis that are available and the little GIF. The GIF, I can just click on it and different GIFs will appear.I can choose one of them to send it directly.I have the stickers, which are little images.And lastly I have schedule a meeting. If I click on ""schedule a meeting"", as you can see, a new window will appear. We are going to talk about the this window a bit further into the training session, but at least you know it's here.Then we have the three little dots, the messaging extension, and if I click on I can add different little applications directly to my conversation: news, places, stocks, weather, Wikipedia search and also YouTube.And, I can create my messaging to be a little more structured than on Skype. It will not simply be different sentences. Now I can put it in bold, highlight, change font, etc. So I can really do a little text rather thanjust sentences.Still, on the instant messaging, I will find back in the tab on the top, as you can see, the Files tab.I will find right here the different files that I have shared with Pierre. I can click on ""share"" from OneDrive or my computer and, right here, I will be able to share documents with Pierre and I will find them all here. On Skype, we did not have thisto find back the documents, while here we can. It will be a little files library with my colleagues and co-workers. Of course, with the little plus button at the top I can add a new tab from different applications: Excel, OneNote, PDF,Power BI, etc. We will have the ability, into the conversation, to have those different applications directly in it. So no need to talk on Teams and then go online and on applications, then share documents. No, I can just go directly into the instant messaging on Teams and work from here.I won't have to use 3, 4, 5 different applications to work with my colleagues. I can go on Teams to do all of this directly.But also aside from the instant messaging, I will have the possibility on the top right, as you can see, to call my colleagues, my coworkers. So the audio call and so I can, as you may know, share my screen. If I call here, for example,so I click on it and it takes a few seconds to load, as you can see on the bottom, I can use the little ""share"" button and they have the three little dots that we will see a bit later during the training session as well. Now let's go directly into the ""meetings"" tabon the left.So, in the ""meetings"" tab, first things first, we will find on the left all of the different meetings that I have scheduled. They are scheduled on Teams or even on Outlook. I will be able to find all of my Outlook meetings directly into Teams.So it will be all on the left and if I click on it, I will find those meetings information, so the day, the hour etc. But I can find the different attendees and also the different information that I put in it, like maybe in which room is the meeting, etc.I can change the views of my calendar. Right here, it's today. But if I click on the three little lines on the left for the agenda view,as you can see we have for the whole month: today, tomorrow, Friday, etc.Right here on the right, on the information pages, I will have the possibility to chat with the participants. So it will open a conversation, cancel the meeting if I'm the organizer. But if I'm not, if I'm an attendee, I will be able to accept it, put it on hold or evensay I won't be present.We have the little links on the bottom. If I click on it, I will join these Teams meetings via Teams online. So it will be like you used to do on Skype when you sent links and you'll be able to click on them to access the meeting. On the top right, we have ""Join"".I will be able with this button to join the meeting directly on Teams being the software or the application.Now, I want to create, to schedule a new meeting. I will click on the bottom left,""Schedule a meeting"". First of all, the title. Let's say, customer meeting.The location will be on Microsoft Teams meeting, so directly into Teams, or I can see it will be in room 1 or 4, for example.When does it start and end? At which hour for the beginning and the end? I have the same scheduling assistant that I used to have on Outlook. So let's invite Amaury, Pierre and then I click on the scheduling assistant and I will find back the scheduling assistantlike in Outlook, but directly into Teams once again.Then I can change the time zone, as you can see, but also, on the bottom, I can add details with the same formatting possible as we saw just before on the instant messaging.On the right, we have ""select the channel to meeting"". So the channel, we have all of the different Teams channel right here. I can click, for example, on ""call for tenders"" and they have the general channel. I can select it and you'll understand just after why I did it.And as you know, I can invite some people right here.So let's just put it in a business team right here.Share once again and maybe Amaury, well Paul. Perfect. I have Paul and Pierre in my meeting in the business team general. Let's schedule this meeting.It's now loading and automatically I'm back in the Teams tab, as you can see on the left, and on the top I have business team and the general channel. As you can see right here, my meeting that I've just created, the customer meeting is now directly integrated into this team.So I can and everybody in this channel, this team will be able to do it as well, I can just click on itand I will have ""chat with the participants"", but it will bring me back into the same channel as I was a few seconds ago, and I can click on ""join"". I click on ""join"".I'm able to activate my video feed or audio feed and I can click on ""Join Now"".I'm connecting to the meeting.And on the bottom, once again audio, video call and I have the ""share tray"". In the share tray, I be able to share my screen, 1 or 2, but also my windows.I can also share my PowerPoints, like I used to do on Skype, and on the right we have the White Board. The White Board, which is not directly from Skype but by 3N by envision, will be a white board quite similar to what we used to have on Skype butwith a few more possibilities, like the presenter mode that will allow us to add information into the board, but automatically, the attendees that are looking at the white board as well, will follow what I do. What I'm trying to say is that, let's say I'm going far rightto add some images, automatically their screen will follow my mouse on the far right.Also I have the three little dots in which we find the keypad. So I think you know about the keypad and how to use it.Then we have the ""start recording"" to record the meeting, the call. I can turn off incoming videos. I don't want to see people's houses or faces while we are in a meeting, I can just turn off the incoming video. Another possibility that we have, but I don't have it right here because Idon't use the webcam, is that I can blur the video feed from me. Let's say I'm at home, I'm doing a meeting with my colleagues, but I don't want them to see whatever is behind me: my house, my family etc. So I can blur the background. They will only see meand the background will be blurred.On the top right, I have the possibility to take notes.Also to talk with a different participant in an instant messaging way,to see the different attendees but also to invite people. And on the top right, I can change the audio devices, the speakers, the microphone and the camera.So, now that you have seen this, one little thing that you will have on the top roght, just next to your picture. You will be able to change your tenants. You'll be able to use Teams on different tenants and so you will haveyour tenants right here on the top, between ""search for"" or ""type a command"" and your picture, you have your tenants and just by clicking on it, you have a list of all of the tenants that you have access to. So you click on one of them and Teams will reload to show the teams of the new tenantwith other teams and other channels, etc. Now, let's go back to our PowerPoint.Now that we've seen the things that are the same on Skype and Teams, let's talk about how to make the transition easier for users.So, we have 3 steps: the communication, the cohabitation and decision making.To begin with, the admin activates the invitation to use Teams, so that the different users will receive an invitation to start use Teams. Just after it, Teams is open to the users. Now, let's go to the cohabitationIn the middle of it, we will have the adoption. At any given moment, users will have or will want to adopt Teams and they will have the Teams training to know how to use it. Then, in the decision making we will have, of course, the decision period.So the idea here is to let the users choose which tools they want to communicate, for what use, at any given moment. You don't want to start by saying: ""You do not have Skype anymore, let's go to Teams"". No. They need to have a transition period.So if Teams is not yet deployed in your company, that can be a good start to use it as a collaborative tool. Give a period of some weeks or even months to your users to use Teams at the same time as Skype. Some users will prefer to use Teams and will influence others to use Teams.Step by step, Teams will take the upper hand, even more if it's used as a collaborative tool. After this given time, you'll have to make a choice: let the 2 applications and give more time to the users if you think they need it; or take out Skype after you have warned the users about it and of course you can choose toend Skype. So the cohabitation, the extension period or Skype Deactivations are the three steps and you'll have to communicate on it for the users to know what will happen to Skype, when they will start to use Teams, etc.So, little conclusion now. First of all, you have time: Skype will not disappear today, you have time to make the transition between Skype and Teams.Of course, don't rush your users or else they will not want to start using Teams if you rush them to it. Let them take time, too. Teams takes the purpose of the perfect collaborative tool: it's complete and intuitive. You also havesome Microsoft resources links that I will share with you directly in the chat. So to help with the transition, the Teams roadmap and the Q&A on Skype to Teams. I will send you those little links into the chat. The chat even the top of the screen, the secondbubble from the left.So the first one, help with transition.Then we have the second one, the Teams roadmap.And lastly we have the Q&A on Skype to Teams.So Q&A Skype/Teams.And lastly, on the MOOC, you'll have courses about Teams and dedicated tutorials.The different Skype and team tutorials, you have them on the screen right now: the different possibilities or to manage your availability and see your coworkers' status, create a contact group, meeting from Outlook, record a meeting, create a live event, invite external people to a meeting, share your screen during a meeting,retrieve information from a meeting, instant messaging with a contact, add a contact to acontact group, and change your peripheral during a meeting. But we have one last thing: the modern workplace cloudworkshop. I'm going to put it right now on screen.So just a few seconds for me to load it on the side and put it on screen just after.So in March, and you'll se in on the screen in a few seconds, you'll have a workshop about, as you can see on the brief overview and who should attend. This workshop is aimed at organization, looking for efficient meansto generate adoption and stimulate greater use of Microsoft 365. When is it? On March, 7th 2019, in London, Westminster Meeting room, Microsoft, 2 Kingdom St. and is from 9:30 AM.And the second part starts at 12 PM.So I will send you this as a link because you can, if you want, register to it to participate. So I will send the link in the chat as well. And so I will call it UK workshop.Right here, so by clicking on this link you can register to this workshop in London.So now if you have any question about everything that we saw today, you can write it directly into the chat. We will take all of those questions, and then we will have in a while shortly a Q&A that will be availablefor you with all of the questions that you've asked and so you'll be able to find back all of the answers to these questions directly in the Q&A.So I will let you the time to write your different questions. Oonce again, you'll find the answers back in the Q&A. I thank you for being here today on this webinar. Make the best use of what you've learned.Have a good day and I hope to see you on another training session.I let you have time to write the different questions, and I will put back the links once again because some people did not find them back, so I will put the different links into the chat.You should have different things. Once again, thank you for being here. I wish you a good day. You still have time to write different questions and I hope to see you on another training session.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],1747.0,webcast

80481,en,Run effective meetings with Teams,14.0,"Welcome everyone to this training sessionon how to run effective meetings on Teams.So, of course, before we begin, we have some recommendation.So, turn off the call waiting.Or else, the hold music could be heard by all participants.Put your phone in mute mode, via the Mute Mic button and,of course, keep your screen active at all times.If you do not touch your PC for a long time,it goes on standby modeand then you'll be automatically disconnected from the session.So today, we have 45 minutes to see different things.To begin with, we'll see how to schedule a meeting.Then we'll see about the Instant meeting, how to Join a meeting,what can we do during a meeting and then the Teams add-in.The objectives today are to learn different ways to create meetingsand how to run the most effective meetingsby using all the tools available.So, I'm going to put Teams on the screen...Right here. So, we are on Teams, we have the little tab on the left.Our different teams are right here, and of course,the view window is on the right.So, first thing you want to do is go in the Meeting tab on the left.In the Meeting tab, I will find right heremy different schedule for the day.As you can see, I have different meetings right here,but on the top right I can change the view right here.I can put it on the agenda view, so I have, as you can see today,tomorrow, Wednesday, etc.And if I go back and then I click on it, I have the day view,which we already saw previously.On the right, I have the possibility to Accept or Declinedifferent meetings.As you can see right here, I can Accept it.Put a Tentative,maybe I would be here or maybe not and I can decline it.Of course, Tentative is when I'm not sure about my different schedules,so I have to check beforehand and then I put tentative in case of,and after it, well, I click on Accept to say that I am available,or not, if I click on Decline.Also right here, you'll see all of the different informationabout the meeting.Of course, right here, we do not have a lot of information,but you will be able to find the phone number,maybe there is a specific link and more information,maybe if you had to bring some things, or location, etc.So now, we are going to click on the bottom lefton Schedule a Meeting.On Schedule a Meeting, we'll have many more possibilities.So to begin with, you have the title.So let's say, simple Team Meeting.Then the location, here we will be online on Teams.So, we're just going to leave Microsoft Teams Meeting,or maybe it's in another place.So, I can put, for example, Room 104.Then I will have to choose the date of this meeting.So let's say tomorrow and then at what time, say 4 p.m.until 5 p.m.Of course, I have the Scheduling Assistant.Scheduling assistant, if I invite some people,so let's add Steven, for example.I can see Steven is scheduled.And so right here, he has no problem with the specific schedule,but if he has problems, as you can see right here,we have different blocks that show there is something at this moment.I can Go Back, I can Close it or I can Schedule the Meeting.Let's go back.Then right here, I can add the details about this meeting.Do not forget about Project Alpha.Once again, on the right, I can invite some people.So if I write some name, for example, as you can see Paul.And on the top right, I can select a channel to meet him.So as I said before, we can do an online meetingdirectly on Teams, but I can select a specific channelin which we'll store the different documents,different information, etc.So I just have to click on it, I have my different Teams right here.Let's go on Alpha Project,and right here we have Alpha 1 and if I choose Alpha 1,as you can see now, we have the channel right here.But Steven was right here and not anymore.It's because we have selected a specific channel,which means that maybe Steven is not part of this channel.So we have to invite him back.This is Steven, and as you can see, Steven is not a member of this channel.So I can't invite him because it's a private channel.But as you can see, Laurent and Philippe are members,so I can invite them, if I want to, of course.Right here.So, whenever I want, I can just click on Scheduleand now I will be automatically back.As you can see on the top, Alpha Project, Alpha 1.And on the bottom right here, I have Amaury,which is my demonstration accountwith little details, don’t forget about Project Alphaand the meeting, Team Meeting I added just before.And if I want to, of course, I can put some Likes,I can Save this message, and also, I can edit itbecause I am the author.Under it, we have Reply.As on any Team current session, I can just add replies to it.We have the same functionalities and optionsthat they normally have on any Teams conversation.So now if I want, I can click on Team Meeting right hereand I will find back all of the different information.I can join this meeting, I can chat with the participants,but I'm already on the good channel so it will only bring me back to it.I can Cancel it, because I'm the organiser,add little details, and, of course, right here we have the link,the link to access this Team Meeting.And on the right, I have the different attendees and, of course,the Alpha Project, which is the name of the team,is also in attendees because everybody in the Alpha Project channelcan access my meeting.I can edit on the right if I want, but I can also close it.So now we also have, if I put Outlook on the screen,the option to create Teams meeting directly on to Outlook.So I just have to click, as you can see on the top,new Teams meeting,just have to wait a few seconds for it to open.As you can see, I have a little link directly into my meeting messageSo as you can see, I can join the Microsoft Teams meeting right hereby clicking on it, and, of course, when I send this message,each of my attendees will receive it with a little link,and if they click on the link, they will be directed into my meeting.And if I create any meeting on Outlook, which I will do right here,let's call it Test Teams,Save and Close.If I go back on Teams on the meeting tab,then I guess, on Thursday,as you can see, we have Test Teams right here.And of course, it's the Outlook meeting that I've just created.And as a Team Meeting tomorrow on 104,if I go back on Outlook,you can find it right here, Team Meeting, room 104.So whenever I create a meeting on Teams, it will be on Outlookand whenever I create a meeting on Outlookit will be automatically on Teams.Now we're going to talk about another subject.So, let's go back on the Teams tab.So...We are going to find right herethe option to create an instant meeting.So how do we create an instant meeting?I'm right here on Alpha 1, I have multiple possibilities.First one, I'm here, on a channel and at the bottomI will have right here a little button, Meet now.Let's click on it.I can add the subject.So let's say, important.And let's say...Johnson Project.I can click on Meet now to create an instant meeting,but we'll see this afterwards.I can Turn off or Turn on my camera if I have oneand I can Schedule a meeting.If I click on Schedule a meeting, as you can see,I have the same window as I had before.I can schedule a normal meeting.But it’s not what we want.So let's go back on it.Let's just call it Project 1and if we can click on Meet now,it will create an instant meeting.We are going to talk about the instant meetinga bit later in this session.So let's close it for now.After it, how to create another instant meeting is with,let’s go back on the top, as you can see Laurent, right here.If I put my mouse on his picture, I will have a little popup.In this popup, I have right here, Audio Calland Audio Call is an instant meeting, but with only one person.If I click on it, as you can see, I'm calling her.And of course, it is not available for now.I'm on the Chat tab as you can see on the top left of the screen,so Chat tab.Once again, I have Laurent right here,and on the bottom, on the top right,we have the possibility to do another audio call.And of course, as it was on the little popup with the picture,I click an Audio Call and once again I'm calling him.So it's another instant meeting.Of course, it's also possible to do it from the mobile device.We are going to see it on the PowerPoint presentationa bit later in the session.But yes, it's possible from the mobile deviceto also create an Instant Meeting.Now, we want to know how to join different meetings.In Teams, on the Meeting tab, of course,I would find all of my different meetingsand if I want to, I can join them.As you can see, I'm on Team Meeting, which is tomorrow.And on the top right, I have the Join button.So Join button, if I click on it, as you can see, I have to choosemy audio and video settings, which we'll doa bit later on this session and I will be able to join this meeting.But we have many more possibilities to do that.As you saw on Outlook, let's go back on it.On Outlook, I have, for example, Team Meeting, right here.And if I open it, automatically, I will have, as you can see right here,join Microsoft Teams meeting.And if I click on it, it will open.I can do it right now.I'll put it on the screen in a few seconds as well.Let's not leave Outlook on the screen.Okay, I am putting it on my main screen right now...Right here.And it's asking me if I want to download a Windows application,if I want to stay on the web to join this meetingand I just have to choose.Either I use the Microsoft app or I want to go directly online.And of course, everybody would be able to do that.So of course, once again, it's a possibility from mobile devicesto be directly on Teams.You click on your meeting, you click on Join the meetingand you'll be on the audio and video feed, of course.If there is any number or participant code to this meeting,you can use your mobile device, or even let's say, Skypeor let’s say Teams to join the audio as well.It's possible with the mobile devices as a phoneand not as a little computer in your pocket to join the meeting.But there is a difference between Meeting and Call.When you call someone, it's a private conversation.It's between you and another person.But when you are in a meeting, you have multiple people in it.And as you can see, on the top right, you have the Join button because,well, the meeting, we have to join a meeting.And for a call, we just have to take or make a call.Be careful.It's possible to join a meeting on Teams with a phone call,but it's not possible to join a phone call on Teams with your mobile.It's, as you're on Teams or you are not, but for a simple call,you'll have to be directly on Teams.And of course, on Teams, it's possible to join a meetingwith different possibilities, different options.It's not mandatory to be directly on Teams.It can be on Outlook, it can be on your mobile device,or, of course, you can be on Teams.So now, what we want to see is what can we do during a meeting?So during a meeting, let's go on a meeting to see it.Let’s click on Join on the top right.So right here, once again, choose your audio and video settings.So I can click on Join Now to join the meeting.I can turn it off or turn on my camera, my mic and I can, of course,change my audio devices, my speaker, my microphoneand my camera once again.At the bottom of the screen, I can see other Join optionand with it as you can see, prevent echowhen there is already an active mic and speaker in the room,which means that I can talk with my mic,but also I can just turn off the audio.So I can hear everything with another mic and speakerand I will prevent the echo by turning it off right here.So now, let's click on Join Now to join this meeting.I'm in the meeting.Of course, I am alone because there is nobody elseon the meeting right now.But when there will be people, even before they arrive,I have multiple options.So let's go on the top right, to begin with.First thing, we have the full-screen mode.If I click on it, well, as you can see I'm now in full screen.I click on it once again.I have the, as you can see on the left,the little tabs from Teams that are back again.After it, we have the meeting notes.In the meeting notes, I would be able to findthe different notes that were taken during of before this meeting.And of course, if I want I can click on the little plus button right here.I can give a name to my notes, so Notes from the UK,for example.And I can put different information right here.But it's not the only thing.As you can see in the top, I have multiple options once again.I can put my text in bold, in italic, underline it,I can even highlight it, change the font colour,change the font size, I can add bulleted listsand numbered list.I can put some quotes, insert linksand I can change my paragraph.I can even add, let's go back on it, I can add picturesand I can add a table.As you can see, I add, quickly, a table.I can put different information in it.And once again, I can change the size, highlight, etc.With the three little dots right here, I can copy this thing,I can move my notes.So let's go on Test 2 to see it.Test 2 is the second, if I move it up, it would be the first.Like this, I can change the place of it all.And of course, I can delete itand copy the link to send this note,well, maybe I want to send it to someone.After it, I would have the show conversation button.In the show conversation button, I will find all of the little commentsthat were under my meeting on the channel.But also, I can find, as you can see, the notes, etc.So I can add a reply, of course, once again on the bottom,I can format it, attach some documents, add some emojis, add some gifs,add some stickers and, of course, little (places).So for example, let’s add quickly an emoji.I click on Send and it will be on the conversation feed on the right.But once again, if I go on the Teams tab,we are on the different teams and in the channel,I will find this little comment under my meeting.Now let's show the participants.I'm finding all the different participants right here.But I can also invite some people.Let's try to add Pierre, for example, I'm adding Pierre.Of course, he is not online for now, but I can add him.And so, I'd find the different personsthat are invited to this meetingand in the top right, I have the Copy Join info.So I can send a link to someone.And by clicking on it, you will be able to join this meeting.Then, of course, the settings of the device.Well, set your devices, camera device and as you can see,is a private viewing that allows the participants to move throughshared presentation on the right.And lastly, we have the info panel.But the info panel right here as you can see is disabledby policies from my company.So it would be on the Office 365 administrator to change this policy.So we saw everything on the top right.Now let's get back at the bottom.At the bottom, to begin with, we are about to turn off the cameraonce again, but also to turn on and turn off my microphone,put it in mute.After it, I will have the share tray.So the share tray, what can I do with it?To begin with, as you can see on the left, I am able to shareone of my screens, we have Screen 1 and Screen 2.If I click on one of it, well, it will show itto every attendee into this meeting.But I can also only share a single window.I don't want to share all of my desktopswith all of my information on it,well, a mistake is quickly made,so we never know.But if I just choose Window, I can just share, for example,a synopsis, a PowerPoint presentation, another window, as you can see,I have Skype right here and Teams will only show this windowand nothing else.If I close the window, if I minimise it,it will show nothing else, only a black screen.I can also on the right, right here,just share a PowerPoint presentation.So if I click on it, it's opening right now,so it will take a few seconds.As you can see, I have my PowerPoint presentation directly on the screenand everybody is seeing it right now at the same time.And at the bottom left, I can choose a slide.I can prevent the participantfrom moving through shared presentations on their own,just have to click on it.And then I have Stop presenting.So if I click on Stop presenting, well, to stop the presentation.Then on the right, we have two possibilities.Microsoft's whiteboard and Freehand by Invision.So I can't show them because I'm the only participant, this time.So it will automatically close, well, once again, before,I'm alone in this.So first of all, the Microsoft whiteboard is quite similarto what you are used to on Skype, for example.You'd be able to write whatever you want, to draw some linesin different colours, etc.But we also have the Freehand by Invision.So you have to sign up to Invision to use Freehand.Freehand, once again is quite similar to what you are used to on Skype,for example, once again, but also it will have a presenter mode.So what is a presenter mode on Freehand?Well, it will lock the video feed of all the participantsdirectly on your mouse.So let's say, you have a big whiteboard.On the top left, you are writing some information,so everybody can see it.But if you want to go on the far right, which is not even on the screen,well automatically the camera, let's say,the video feed of the attendees will follow your mouse across the pageon to the far right and they will see what and where you are writing.So it would really follow your mouse whenever it goeson the whiteboard and whatever you kind of write or add, or draw.Well, they will see it directly.They won't to have to search everywhere on the blank board to find it.Well, they will just follow your mouse whenever it goes.So, of course, during a team meeting, there are a lot of possibilitiesto add information to your presentation, but also to have better collaboration.But it's not all.We have another thing to show.Let's close this meeting.When we go on the Teams tab,right here you can see the Hello hall that is written just before.And as I said it is directly into the comments section.But if we go back to the meeting,let's Join it.Right here on the bottom right, we have more action.So one of the actions that we can't seebecause I do not have a video feedis the blur video feed, which means, let's say,you are, maybe, on the move, in a hotel or maybein another company working with some of the external colleagues.You don't want, during a meeting, to show what is happening beside you.So you can blur your own video feed, which means that automaticallyand in live, Teams will find you, let's say, the human bodyand also Teams will know what is not useful in this presentation.So everybody is going to see you, well as clear as waterso as on any video feed, but everything that is beside you will be blurredand you're going to see it on the PowerPoint presentation.We have the keypad. So, the keypad, well, you know what it's used for.You can compose different numbers and then call different people.But you need a special licence for this.You can start to record the video and audio feed.So by clicking on it, you would record everythingthat you can see on the screen right now and everything that you can hear.And then turn off incoming videos.Well, you don't want to see, let's say, you have ten peopleon Teams with video cameras on.You don't want to see everybody's faces.Well, you just turn off the incoming video and then you will only seewhat we have right now on the screen, but we have little bubblesforeveryone on this meeting.So we saw everything we wantedto see about what we can do during a Team meeting.But now, we have different Teams add-in.So we already saw Outlook.But there is one more, it's OneNote.On the top right here, we have different tabs.If I click on the Plus button, I will have another,well another possibility.As you can see, there are a lot of them, but on the top right,we have OneNote.So you may already know OneNote.It's an application in which you can take different notes.You can add it directly onto Teams and everybody in these teams,right now we are in this one, well, everybody in itwill be able to open this OneNoteand write anything they want in itand see everything that you have written, etc.It will be a collaborative tool directly in Teams.And of course, as you saw, there is a lot of applicationslike that in Teams.So now let's go back on the PowerPoint presentation.So, to schedule a meeting, we have as well the meeting tab.We can see in Agenda view or Day view,we have the New live event to do a live event.And it's like an accept, decline or maybe be here in a meeting.Of course, we also have different ways to communicate instantly.We have the phone calls, and also a little popup to find it.And also the Instant Meeting and as you can see on Teamson mobile devices, I can make a call just by selecting someone.To join meetings, well, from the meeting tab,from the mobile app but also from Outlook.As you can see on the mobile app, well,we will find all my different meetings, I just have to press Join to join that.And during meetings, we have different tools available.So is the sharing tray, we have the shared notebook,a record or blur network video streams and last chat.As you can see right here for the blurring,well we can see the trainer right here, but we can see whatever is behind him.We can see colours, we can see…Maybe a dog but we don't really know.If you have questions, do not hesitate.I will answer them.And if you don't have any questions, do not forget to go directlyinto the training platform to evaluate this session.Of course, I thank you for being here today.Put it to good use and I hope to see you in another training session.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],1925.0,webcast
84090,en,Teams - Driving Teams Adoption,66.0,"Hello everyone. Welcome to this online session called ""Driving Teams Adoption"".My name is Dina and I will be your trainer today. To begin with, I would like to inform you that you have the possibility to ask questions during this live session via chat and you will also find the answers on our blog the following week.Be advised that this webinar is being recorded. You will have the opportunity to view it soon after on our MOOC platform.Before I start this presentation and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly, it is important to listen to the following instructions carefully. There are precisely two. The first one is:On your end all the participants microphones have been switched off. As you may all know, some of you may be working in an open space environment, so those are just cautionary measures to avoid unpredictable or unwanted background noise.The second and last one is: Remember to keep your computer screen active at all timesby wiggling the mouse every now and then.It is very important not to let your PC go into sleep mode as this will cause the interruption of the video and you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeat the login steps all over again to get back in it.This is not going to be a training session. It is not from a technical point of view that we are going to address this session. Instead we are going to focus on a faster new approach to work while advocating or embodying best practices.Driving Teams Adoption is enabling the modern workplace with Office 365 and we're going to see this together.I don't think I have ever been to an online session that was so overbooked so I really want to thank you all for showing such enthusiasm about our product.During this 30-minute session here are the items we will be discussing: The introduction on ""Why change?""We'll see what the purpose of using Teams is, in what way and for whom.We'll find out how to organize that transformation and how to offer teams support.This will also be followed by a few good practices and your conclusion.The objectives here are to identify the steps to drive adoption and to turn towards a transition approach.Why change?The evolution of the way we work.Well before you,you have an idea of what past conditions looked like. Back then, employees spent the whole day in the office, behind a desk, with a landline telephone, getting up only to attend weekly meetingsin a conference room next door. Well, those days are long gone. These days,telework, nomadism, business travels are very common in companies. According to studies,employees are 4 times more likely to work in mobility today than in 2007.Today we can work, communicate and collaborate anytime from anywhere, and via many tools and especially with the software Microsoft Teams.What is collaboration? How do we work today?First, imagine yourself at the center of the company,in your own organization, being surrounded byall your colleagues.We can view different teams working on different projects internally.I want you to also imagine yourself floating over that structure, so you can have a panoramic viewon the whole company.Now, you're looking down and you can actually see every single colleague working and you understand their role in the company better. You see how you're exchanging on every projectand also that you are exchanging with outside personnel, external partners, subcontractors, vendors.You have to work inside the loop and outside the loop.What is collaboration? To collaborate means to work towards the same results with several people and, for instance, by creating a document, setting up a project, etc.But the problem lies when emails are heavily used as a collaboration tool.Emails are indeed a very bad place to store permanent information.Understand that collaboration increases the teams flexibility and capacity to adapt.Team members will begin to embrace change rather than fear it and will most likely learn to turn a potentially problematic situation into an opportunity.How do you changeyour ways? How do you get rid of old habits?This is the Current State representingthe supervisor writing down a list of tasks and then distributing them or assigning them to each employee. So it goes from the top to the bottom. That's the way we are actually working today.For instance, sending an email with an attachment to 12 employees in your organization to update a presentation is quite unproductive.Imagine an Excel spreadsheet with 12 people. So here I am updating the spreadsheet. I'm saving it and attaching it to an email, sending it to another colleague. This one is doing the same thing and then proceeding to the next one and the next one. In the end I get that spreadsheet back, but it hass been going back and forth among us.We have been saving it either local in our inbox or on our desktop or some other location. But in the end we have given it so many titles: version 1, version 2, version 3.""Final version"". No, this is the ""one"". Seriously, can you imagine how chaotic this would be? You wouldn't even know what is the most updated version. Here is the delay.Now we want to move,change long-standing practices of collaboration to a new tendency because the tendency is likely for an employee to drop a document in Microsoft Teams and then directly use the co-editing feature or possibly via Office Online or the local application itself.Evolution of the way we work will havea profound impact on the change of corporate culture.Only employees must be driven to this transformation, not only through the use of new digital tools, but especiallythrough a major change of management.From top to bottom doesn't work anymore. We want to make all the employees more autonomous. We want them to think for themselves and to find the solutions themselves in any project assigned.So we're going from microscopic to macroscopic to autonomous. That's what we're really looking for. To change people's way of thinking you must also offer them support in this new approach to work.So what is the purpose of using Teams, in what way and for whom?Discovering and understanding Teams is the first step. First, understand channels and Teams to communicate better.Channels are topics and Teams are basically your tribes of people who come togetherto work towards the same goal.So you have your Teams under your channels, which are your topics.In order to do that, you've got to create your first Team. You also have to know how to access Office 365 online.You need to get your notebook in OneNote or your application SharePoint, Planner, Stream, etc.You must also provide your teams with collaboration, adding tools,by structuring your channels and at the same time demonstrate how to add tabs to integrate third party applications such as Trello, Jira,Adobe and so on.You have to explain the unique access to the tools and files within a single interface, enabling them to understand how Teams can improve their collaborationbeyond conversations and file storage capability.But most of all, using Teams yourself is essential to positively influence others into adopting your project, so you got a short example.First, you put in place base case scenarios.You want to meet the stakeholders within your division or department to define their needs.Then, you want to define use case scenarios, like base business scenarios, and imagine different jobs scenarios.Then you start small by selecting scenarios that correspond to high, low, medium level of difficulties, so that you can implement that impact.The second step would be to conduct pilot tests.Identifying and selecting your professional application scenarios will enable you to set up pilot tests. Conduct a pilot test by including professional users and IT experts.Also get direct users feedback. That's very important regarding their experience with Teams and their ideas for use in further work.After that, share experience feedbacks. That's very important. Ask for instancethe first integrated users to give their opinions, comments and collect any information they may have because overtime sharing examples coming from your own company's or department's user experiencecan be extremely useful to promote and achievesustained change, because sustained change is what we are looking for.Feedback is at the heart of new methods of work from new technologies.Finally,you have to communicate your vision.You have to explain your choices.You have to articulate the benefits expected for the company,the department and employees. Express internal delays,explain the issues.Especially take the time to explain the benefits.How to organize the transformation?You identify first the stakeholders, the key ambassadors and sponsors because those are your friends. Study their profiles as they will be the ones to carry outthe project. Without them, there is no chance of adoption.They are your friends.Study the profiles.Then design, launch and manage your adoption campaign.Deploying the software alone will not bring about change in your organization.You have to create or build a desire for users to use Microsoft Teams.But of course, hide the irritants first, highlight the benefits for the user and the company.Promoting collaboration is more about people and not technology.Too many changes may affect acceptance and productivity. If more than 3 changes are underway, consider facing these out.Then, create an adoption program with the deployment of Teams.The collaborative part above all is a state of mind and values. Educate users to the growing effectiveness and collaboration opportunities that technology offers.Then you want to provide a standard feedback method.Build this method around employees experience.Measure and share the overall success. That is very important. Identify the measures of success in advance by comparing the benefits versus the irritants.Then you adapt your messages and methods based on feedback.The lack of flexibility is a major obstacle to its development.So you have to prepare employees to change the way they work.Resistance to change is the most natural response. You have to reduce the impact.Howto offer teams support.First, they must be at the center of this change. It is essential to offer employees support with training on tools and uses in order to prepare them for cultural change.You have to build their confidence.First, you prepare the cultural change.Users generally do not like change, they especially dislike changes.There are useless and that do not aim to make their life easier.They don't like the fact that they have to relearn everything they know,especially a process they have known for the longest time and that suits them just fine.And why would they want to be out of their comfort zone?No one likes that so the only changes accepted by users are those they perceive as a benefitand added value.So you really have to highlight the benefit.Then you introduce the scope of use.By asking the following questions: When to use this new tool next to my existing technology?Who is allowed to use this tool with me? Is it safe for highly confidential information?Those are the 3 main questions that we run into mostly.You get to the awareness and training portion. You have to provide appropriate training by using case studies or base case scenarios.Offer short training resources with video tutorials, use case scenarios and do not neglect the strengthening of knowledge becauseit allows anchoring of new practices in patterns over the long term and long term is what you're looking for.The proximity relays.Why are those vital?The ambassadors, the coach, the sponsors.Because those people, those friends have tested the tool. They will capitalize and accumulate experience into knowledge.Those same people will influence within the teams through informal conversations, like in cafeteria. They will spread so fastand more effectively anchor the knowledge becauselearning through colleaguesis one of the most effective and the most used methods. Explain the meaning of transformation an reassure those users,share your feedback.and create the emulation, enthusiasm and motivation that promote the adoption of methods of work.You want to have teams apply the new methods of work.Share the feedback with the project team and sponsors themselves.To drive Teams adoption, what are the errors to avoid? Focus on the human being rather than the technical aspects of the project.Focusing on the technical aspect of how Teams is to bring about change is the most common error. The project must be carried by 3 pillars of equal importance:The people, the technology and processes.Excluding VIPs.Involving VIPs in the project could speed up the transmission of information to different teams.Do we want that? In addition to the director of information systems commitment,sponsors do provide visible and active support. You've got to think about a listing.Training and equipping local relays.For a failed adaptation, a centralized online communication will do.The support of a local network of ambassadors would improve efficiency and would cause an overload of activity of the support services.Send only an email as a communication strategy/plan. Avoid sending just a single email.Preparing a communication plan an yet underestimating the importance of communication today is to have the misleading impression of saving time.The reality here is that you are wasting considerable time over the long run with employees that are showing very little motivation and the means are not missing to unite (display, Intranet stand etc.)arounda project and its benefits.Neglecting or skipping training.If the topics are too general and boring,t hose types of training have proven to be counterproductive.However, they are still very useful when they are adapted and contextualized and placed in a particular concept.Imposing the tool or forcing the tool on employees. Don't change anything or rather be brutal, just sort everything out the window.Those 2 reactions are the safest way to failure. It is advised to go for a soft gradual integrationby using baby steps, taking the time to explain things clearly to your employees.This will open the way to abetter adoption and integration.Make Skype and Teams coexist.Forgetting to reinforce change.Users have access to the tools.They have been trained, adaptation is complete. Wrong again: you want to make sure the project is a success.You have to drive adoption to optimize it.Analyze, keep training, keep communicating, offer your employees support at all timesto make that project a succes. Share with them, the overall success.Relying solely on good fortune.Relying on luck and good chance will not lead to a positive outcome. The last common error is to hope that adoption falls in naturally.We must instead anticipate adaptation troubles andat the same timedetect these problems ahead of time, so that we may respond to those issues better and faster.It is as if there was no resistance to change.So.A few good practices.Always run and leave the application open.If you want people to use the application, it should always be open.Teams and Skype coexist very well so start using Teams via instant messaging.Then you want to centralise topics. First, start by centralizing your project information in one place.Avoid the fragmentation of your project simply by using the chat feature instead of email messages when exchanging with the key actors of the project. Work together more closely around common projects.Give visibility into ongoing work. Most of the companies work in ""Project Mode"" with cross-cutting teams and subcontractors which, naturally, induces an explosion in the number of exchanges.Then you want to promote communication.Understand how Teams can improve collaboration beyond the help of conversation and file storage features. The coordination of projects is improving thanks to the almost immediate reactions of colleagues online.Improve readability where you can easily locate information to coordinate teams actions and projects instead of emails.Chat with your team users and communicate with team users from a different organization.Share and co-edit documents. That's the novelty.Answer the questions. Most of the users are scared that another colleague will delete data by mistake.You have to stop sending emails people.121 emails received per day: basically it's an email every 4 minutes.This means that if we prioritize reading emails, we can focus more than 4 minutes at a time on one topic.We always go back to our old habits very fast.So, please try to correct that one immediately. Stop sending emails.In conclusion.Prepare your organization for collaboration in Teams. Encouraging change in your organization is a constant activity, not an event. To successfully drive teams adoption,stay focused on your employees experience.This webinar has finally come to an end.Thank you all for participating to this online session, it's been a pleasure exchanging with you all.Enjoy our platform and get the most out of it.

84715,en,OneDrive - Discover the online storage tool,19.0,"Hello everyone and welcome to this online sessioncalled Discover the Online Storage Tool.My name is Thomas and I will be giving this presentation today.Before I start and in order to ensure that it runs smoothly,it's important that you listen to the following instruction carefully.So the first one is during this presentation,please do not take call waiting or second call.The music on hold will start playingand we'll no longer be able to hear one another.Second one is on your end, please turn the microphone offby switching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may be working in open space environment,so those are just cautionary measure to avoidunpredictable or unwanted background noise.The third and last one is to remember to keep your computer screen activeat all times by wiggling the mouse every now and then.It’s very important that you do not let your computer go into sleep mode, as this will cause the interruption of the videoand you will find yourself kicked out of this online session.The inconvenience here is that you will have to repeat the log in stepall over again to get back in it.So today, we have 45 minutes to see, well, a few things about OneDrive.First of all, let's just have the little arrows: what is the Cloud?How to load and share documents?How does OneDrive work with Office?A little Q&A in the end,then of course we will see the rest of the study plan.The objectives are to share and collaborate with documents,but also to go to the MOOC platform to further our training.So first of all, let's open a new web page.On this web page, I'm going to look for in the address bar in the top,I'm going to look for portal.office.com.I press Enter and I will be pointed to the Office online portal.So what can we find here?First of all, we are going to find our different applications right here,Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc.Just by clicking on one of them, well, I will access it directly online.Of course if I want to have them directly into my computer as software,on the top right I can install Office.After it, I will find the different documents.Right here we have the rRecommended documents, but also the Recent ones,the Pinned ones, the ones that are shared with meand the ones that I can discover.Then on the bottom, I will have my recent OneDrive folders,my frequent SharePoint sites and the SharePoint sites that I'm following.On the top left, I will have what we call the online start menu.In the online search menu, I will find back one again my different applications,but if I click on All Apps right here,I will open as you can see a window with all of my applications in it.As you guessed, I have way much more applications right herethan I have on my main page.And of course, on the top right if I want to,I can edit my profile and my account.So let's close that and we will go directly into OneDrive.Before OneDrive opens, let's go back into our PowerPoint presentation.So of course we saw the portal.office.com to access the online start menu,but also what is OneDrive.Well, OneDrive is an online storage space.Your documents will be stored online,which means that you'll be able to access them whenever and wherever you want.Those documents will be saved on this specific unique server,so you won't have to bring your USB keys and your external hard drivewherever you go.No.You just need your login, your password and you'll be ablefrom any Internet-connected device -a smartphone, a tablet, a computer-you'll be able to access OneDriveand you'll be able to find back all of your documents.And I know what you're going to say.""Yeah, but if I update a document on my computer, I don't want every timeto go back on OneDrive to edit it, to have the same document everywhere"".Well, with OneDrive, we can synchronise it with our computer, which means- you are going to see that in a few minutes into the session-with the synchronisation, well,every document online will be synchronised offline,which mean I'll find back all of the different modifications that I've made, but also any modification that I made offline will be online too.So I can edit my documents and if they are synchronised,well, they will be edited online and offline at the same time.And of course we will be able to share our documents.New possibilities: before we had the attached files on our emails;well, no, we'll be able to share our documents.So let's go back on OneDrive right here.Let's talk a bit about the interface.Well, first of all, on the top, we have four possibilities:New to create new documents, Upload to upload documents,Flow to add workflows to OneDrive and Sync to synchronise.We'll go back on it afterwards.On the left, we have the search bar and different tabs.Files, Recent, Shared, Discover and the Recycle bin.Then we have our different SharePoint sites.And of course in the middle, we have all of our different documentsand folders as you can see at the top.So I have right here Confection Sales 2013.Let’s click on it.In here, well, I have different information, but the most important things to rememberis that I can go on it, add information.So I will just add some gibberish and at the top right herewe have ""Confection Sales 2013 - saved"".If I add information, as you will see in a few seconds, ""saving"".So it’s very quick.So we just have to look quick.But ""saving"" because any documents that I have onlineand more specifically on OneDrive, they will automatically save everything that I do,which means that I won't lose anything if there is a power surge,maybe my computer is out of battery, etc., well,it will save everything.Of course we may lose some information, maybe the three or four words last written on it,but well, it's nothing compared to what we are used to.Let's say, we have Excel as a software.We are editing our document, it's been hours.I did not save it because well I would save it at the end.Then power surge, everything is lost.Not with OneDrive, not with the online applications.So also we have, well, the folders.If I click on a folder, I will access whatever is inside it.Nothing new, but it's important to mention it.What about those tabs on the top?New: by clicking on New, I can create a new folder,a new document Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote,but also a Forms document.If I want to, I can also add links.Let's try to add a PowerPoint presentation.Right here, of course, I can do my PowerPoint,add information, add pictures, etc.And right here, we have ""Presentation"".By clicking on it, I can change its name.Let's call it ""Test PowerPoint OneDrive"".It's saved.I can just close it.I can refresh my web page and of course I will find back Test PowerPoint OneDriveright here a few seconds ago as you can see.So I can create any Office documents directly into OneDrive.What's the catch here?Well, our online application are a bit less advancedthan the one installed in our computers.It's not something, well, just crazy.It's not like one of them is in 2019 and the other one is in 2014, no.It's just little possibilities that are not here and there.But once again nothing crazy.We can totally work online without any problem.It’s when we will want to go on more advanced things on our documentsthat it may be difficult because the online version can't manage everything.After it, I have Upload, Files or Folder.Directly from my computer, I can click on Files for example.Here I just have to find a document.I click on Open.It will upload it as you can see in the top right, ""Uploaded 1 item to Files"",and right here we have DD Base PowerBI.Then the workflow of course and we have the synchronisation.We will go back on it at the end of the training session.On the top right, of course, you have uploaded one item to Files,I can show progress if I want to, but well, it’s done so no progress to show.Then I can open the view options menu to see in list,in compact list or in tiles.Also I have the details panel.The text panel, well as you can see, there is just the different information,you edit it, the Base PowerBI, you created, etc.But if I click on a document, let's say, Confection Sales 2013,I check it.Then I click on the top right in the details paneland I will have the activities about this site only.I will have a preview right here, the number of views just under it,who has access to it, it's just me for nowand the different activities right here.Well, I just edited the file, so not really any activity about it.And if I click on More Details, we'll have some more advanced details about it.Let's continue with Confection Sales, we'll either do a right clickor we click on the three little dots on the right.I can open the document, I can open it in Excel Online, but also in Excel installed on my computer.I can preview it, I can share it, we'll go back on it just after,copying a link also, I can download it, delete it,move it to maybe another folder, another SharePoint, I can copy it, same thing, folder or SharePoint, I can rename it, add workflows,a version history and the details.Details, we saw that on the top right with the details panel,that's the version history.As you can see, I have different versions in these documents;one, two, three, four, five and it can go, it’s nearly limitless.So the first version will be the creation of the document.As you can see on the 15th of September 2017 is the creation of the document.And now, seven minutes ago the top, well, it’s the latest edit,the latest modification.If I want to, I can click let's say on the fourth version,can restore it, open it to see what's in it or delete it.If I restore it, I will have as you can see just now a new version,the sixth one.Well, it's the exact same version as the fourth one except now it's in the top.So whenever I open the document, well it will be the sixth versionthat will be opened.Let's talk a bit about the sharing.Right click on the three little dots, Share.Right here, we have a little rectangle on the top.Let's click on it.Who would you like this link to work for?Anyone with the link.Be careful with that.Anyone with the link and of course it's mentioned herethat my organisation is preventing me from taking this option,maybe it will be the case for you.Anyone with the link, it means anyone, anyone in the world.You send this link, I don't know, to somebody you know in Australia,if you work in the US for example, who will be able to open it, no worries.So that's why some companies prevent employees to use this optionbecause well, mistake can occur, we are all humans, and it can happen.People in your tenant name right here with the link.So let's say, you work for a Company 01,it will be people in Company 01 with the link.It is the same as before.You can send the link to anyone who will be able to open it,but only if they have the same tenant as you, so Company 01, for example.People with existing access, you already shared this document before.You don't want to add or remove people in the sharing.You just want to generate a new sharing link.So you just check people with existing access.Then we have specific people.Specific people as the name implies, well, you choose specific peopleby name to share these documents with them.Allow editing; if I want to, I can allow or not the edition of my document.And I can, if I want, block as a download,but as you can see, we have to uncheck Allow editing to block the download.I uncheck it to be able to block it.Yes, we can apply.I need to choose, well, the specific people that I want.I will just add Pierre and Laurent.I can add a message if I want to.""Here is the document I was talking about"".I can send it.If I send it, my co-workers will have access to the documentand they will receive a little notification by mail that just says""Oliver shared a document with you, here is the link"".If I click on Outlook right here, it will open a new mail in Outlookwith the link in it and I will be able to write my own mail with the document.Then lastly, copy a link.I have a little link right here that is now copied.I can paste it on a mail, on instant messaging,on a smartphone message and my colleagues, by clicking on it,will access the document.So it was the sharing and of course right click, copy link,it’s the same as we just saw.We can…Here's our copy link or we can do let's say the long sharingby the Sharing button to be more specific about what type of sharing that we want.Now, on the left.On the left I have the Files tab.So that's what we are talking about since a few minutes.Recent: Recent is the documents that were edited recently.Shared, right here.I will find all of the documents that are shared with me-I am not the creator of it, some people are sharing it with me-but also shared by me, I am the creator of the document,I am sharing it with other people.Discover: it will be documents that maybe I am interested about, maybe not.Just documents I have access to, if I want to I can click on one to see it.And the Recycle bin, well, it will be the documentsbut also the versions that I deleted.I will find them back right here.So the default option for the Recycle bin, the documents stay in here for 30 days,then in the second stage Recycle bin,they will also stay here for 30 days, so you have 60 days in totalto go back and find back your documents, your versions.Let's click back on files right here.We have the search bar on the top left.Right here, you can search for documents.Let's look for ""trends"".And as you can see, I find back two documents that are named ""Trends"".If I click on See More Results, I can filter it.It depends on the date and the type of documents,on the people that created it.I can just edit it right here.Then we have the synchronisation.Synchronisation, if I click on it, well you will have to open Microsoft OneDriveon my computer to synchronise it.I won't do it right here because, well, it may take some few minutes,so I don’t want to make you lose your time.So what is the synchronisation for?We already talked a bit about that in the beginning.If I synchronise a computer, I will have into my File libraryon my computer, I will have a OneDrive folder.In it, I will find the exact same document as I have online.If I edit the documents online, it will be edited on my computer.If I edit it on my computer, it will be edited online.If I delete a document, it will be deleted from the other side as well.And of course, what's the real use of the synchronisation?Well, at any time I'm on my computer, I edit a document,I don't have to load it back on OneDrive.I know that the synchronisation will do it for me.And so, well, just simply, I will have the possibilityto have my document on my computer directly synchronised to OneDrive.I am on the move.I go see my co-workers in another geographical site for my company.Well, I'm going to connect myself to OneDrive,I will find back all of my documents.I don't have once again to bring my USB stick,to bring my external hard drive, etc., no.And they can be stolen as well on the way or on the train, etc.,so no need.We just have to know our log in and password and don't worry,it's very secure because well, there are Microsoft serversand they know that your information, that your data are important,so it's very, very secure.So lastly, we can go on let's say a Word document,so we will open a Word document on the screen from my computer,not from the online version, from my computer.So I'm opening it on the side, it will open on the screen in a few seconds.So we will just open a blank document that doesn't have anything on it.If I go on File on the top left, here I will have Save as to begin withand I can save it on my OneDrive or my SharePoint.But also, I have Share.Directly from my computer, I can share a document with of course OneDrive.And on the top right, I also have Share right here.And so, by clicking on it, I can once again share my documents.It will be the same for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.Let's go back on our PowerPoint presentation.The loading and sharing?Yeah, we saw that on OneDrive, we'll have on the right of the documentif a document is shared or not.And by right clicking on the three little dots, we will have the Share option.For OneDrive and Office, of course, we just saw it.We have in the Files tab, in Files menu, the option to save or to shareour document with OneDrive and SharePoint, to save my documents on OneDrive,to share with my SharePoint site's members on SharePoint.We saw everything that we have to see today on OneDrive.If you have question, don’t hesitate.I'm here to answer them the best that I can.And if you don’t have any question, well, do not forget about our training platform.I know that all of you already know about that.So I won't go back on it.But don't forget about the little calendar to find backall of our training session depending on the date.You don't have to, let's say, you want a training session about SharePoint,you go on the SharePoint's page and you find different dates,but I know the best one for you.Well, even the calendar, you find the date that you want to,let's say, Wednesday, and on Wednesday, you will find backall the training sessions available this day.It may not be SharePoint, but it may be some other training sessionsthat are interesting to you.Then on your dashboard, on the MOOC platform,you have the most consulted, recommended for youand the most recent training sessions.Most consulted and most recent training session,well, it will allow you to stay well on point on what are the most recent ones,the most consulted one, etc.But the recommended for you, the more you follow training sessions,the best will be the algorithm for the training session recommended for you.So well, you will find a training sessionthat you may like that are recommended for you.If everything is good for you today, of course,I thank you for being here today.Put it to good use, put to good use what you learned today about OneDrive.I bid you all a good day.Once again, thank you for comingand I hope to see you all on another training session.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],1562.0,webcast

These colored dots made my life easy! Now in Teams, I can locate all my contacts... Yet, how can I be sure that I will not disturb them when I try contacting them?Not a problem.In Teams availability statuses work about the same way.And this is how.In my offline app,I can always see my status thanks to the dot shown next to my profile pic.To change it, I click on my pic and select my new status.When I select a canal, I can see the members pic along with the colored dot indicating their current status next to each comment. And if I wish to find out more, I click on the conversation tab and locate my contact list.I can see everyone’s status and know when they are available to chat with, if needed.So even if the interface looks slightly different, Teams allows me as in Skypeto keep visibility on my status and that of my contacts.

I give it a name; Once created, this one appears on the left-side navigation. I can then add contacts to this new group,by doing a name search.Subsequently, I can rename this group as needed, or even remove it. Beware, unlike SKYPE, it is not possible in Teams to directly contact all members of a contact group.If I want to contact several of my colleagues,I'll more likely use the team channels.Or on the other hand,through the ""Chat"" mode, I select the first participant then add more as I go along.Even if the procedure is slightly different,just as in Skype, Teams enables me to create and sort contact groups.Great, this makes more sense now.Thanks Coach!",2019,N/A,[],"['Microsoft Teams', 'Skype VS Teams']","['Organize', 'Customize']",108.0,tutorial

I got a question for you.In Skype, I could delete my private and group conversations.But now I can't do it anymore, Coach, is this normal?Yes, it’s quite normal.Simply because Microsoft Teams does not allow the deletion of conversations.Ok… So how do I hide or archive the conversation history?I mean, chats do accumulateand with the volume, I’ll get confused…Don't panic!You may not delete conversations from Teams;However, you do have the possibility to delete some messages within the conversation,thanks to the three tiny dots next to the message.All right, but I need more.I really want some old conversation not to be visible anymore.I really want them gone from the thread of my conversation.Well, in this case, just click on the menu and select ""Hide"".When you reply to a message, the conversation will appear again!So, just remember: It is not possible to delete a conversation from Teamsbut you do have the option to hide a conversationor delete one single element from a conversation!Wonderful!

Tell me if I got this right…We agree that Microsoft Teams is more about instant messaging; It is also a complete collaborative space where you can exchange with colleagues, right?So far, yes…So, here is my problem:My company got users who only need instant messaging service and not the full collaborative environment.I see…So how do I get these people to only have access to instant messaging?I mean, is there a ""limited"" or ""light"" version of Teams?Well, to answer your questionwhat you need to know firstis that when you initially launch Teams, you are not automatically added to groups.And this means that you initially only have access to instant messaging: IM.Wow! It is simple as that?Yes, it is.And if one day, you do have the opportunity to integrate this messaging service with a collaborative space, all you got to do then is add the users to these teams.As a result, they all will have access to Cloud applications,document libraries and teams.Who the heck is Cloud?And why, on earth, would they have access to this guy’s teams?Oh no… Cloud is not some guy,it is the name of a document storage and online hosting application!Duh…  The Cloud!My bad.

117891,en,What are the best practices in Teams ?,43.0,"Hello everyone and Welcome to this webinar about ""What are the Best Practices in Teams?"". As you may have noticed your mics are turned off because there are a lot of participants in today's training session, so it would be very noisy if everyone had their mics on. Microphones will be shut off for this training session. Let's begin right now.Some instructions to begin: Turn off call waiting, if you take another phone call during this webinar, the music on hold will be heard by all participants.Microphones are muted, and think of keeping your screen active at all times. If you do not touch your computer for a little while, it will go into sleep mode. If you go to sleep mode, you'll be automatically disconnected from this webinar and there's a time to reconnect to it, so you will lose information.So today, we have 30 minutes to see different things. To begin with, the introduction: What is Teams used for? We're going to talk about Teams. but what is the use of Teams? What are we going to do with it?Then, understanding your collaboration.What can we do in terms of collaboration in Teams? We will understand all of this.The 10 collaboration best practices in Teams. Today is a webinar about the best practice in Teams, so we're going to see them of course.How to spread and share best practices. It's a thing to know about the best practices, but it's another thing to share and spread them in your company. Finally, we'll have the conclusion at the end.The objectives today are to identify the best practices for using Teams and to encourage companies' collaboration in Teams. Also at the end of this training session,if you have other good practices in Teams that we haven't shown today, you can write them in the chat. I'm going to send a message in the chat right now for you to see it.We will be able to send your best practices in it for us to find them back.To begin with, the introduction: What is Teams used for? As you can see on the screen, Microsoft has deployed a graphical representation of how to use their communication applications, because we have Teams, Yammer and Outlook. We have the inner loop, the outer loop and the open loop. The are all important to keep in mind when talking about Teams in comparison to Outlook.To begin with, we have the outer loop on the right with Yammer.The outer loop with Yammer and Outlook. It is called the open loop as well. Outlook is made for your open loop: You can send emails to anyone with an email address. But you should always be careful about what you write in your messagesin fear that someone important could receive it as a transfer. Emails are more formal, more concrete, less arbitrary. Outlook should be used to send official messages to your clients, suppliers, etc.Then we have the internal loop.We have Teams. Teams is really made for your inner loop (the internal loop). Think about the constant conversation that you have with those you work with, including people outside of your company.And the files you review as well.Teams is the right place to work. Conversations are informal, short and direct.You work with very united teams, and that includes external people who are not a part of your network.Teams is destined to become an essential entry point when you start your workday, just like Outlook. Everyday when you go on your computer at work, you open Outlook for your emails. But you should do the same with Teams: All of your inner collaboration conversations will be on Teams.What does Teams allow? Flexible communication in real time, the content and history are available at anytime, including Teams cross-sessions visible to all team members.It's integrated to SharePoint and OneNote. There is a strong integration with the Office suite.And customizable workspace to include content and features that teams use every day.Let's go on. We are going to talk about collaboration.Understanding your collaboration: Nowadays, Outlook is the user's personal EDMS (Electronic Document Management System).It's Well, you're going to find back a lot of documents but it is a bit strange to say that we are going to find all our documents into Outlook because when you send files via emails, the only way to retrieve those files is in the emails. But we're going to talk about this in a bit.In Outlook, the information is stored and contained in the message: Tables, pictures, attachments.The attachments and different or multiple versions of a document are stored in it.But the message storage quota is insufficient. We do not have infinite space in Outlook and we're going to multiply those attachments, pictures, etc. So the storage is insufficient.Meetings and meeting notes are stored. When you organize a meeting in Outlook, you're going to find all the notes about this meeting in here.You spend time looking for information. You have thousands of emails and you have to search, filter to find them back.Of course, managing emails is time-consuming and detrimental to productivitybecause you lose hours because you need to filter, to organize etc. It takes a lot of time.You store the same information as your colleagues in different files and ask them to transmit it when you cannot find it. When someone sends an email to 10 people with attachments in, those same people are going to have the attachment. But you can't find it back because of too much emails, so you are going to ask your coworkers to send it back.You are going to have 2,000 or 3,000 of emails with the same attachments in it, because you cannot find them back in Outlook.That is time-consuming and storage-consuming.Losing messages would be a disaster for the company. Inside emails, you have a lot of important information, attachments, files, documents.The problem here is that we have them in Outlook, so we are not going to download them because we have them in our mailbox.But one day, a problem can occur and your emails will be lost along with important, emails, information and documents.What are we going to do? We cannot do anything, we are going to lose our messages. It's going to be a disaster.When employees leave, their messages may be transferred to another employee so you have. Let's say you have spent 10 year in a company.Today, your coworker who also worked in your company is leaving.So all his emails, 10 years worth of emails are going to be transferred to who? To you.So you have in total 20 years of emails in your Outlook inbox.We can say that is going to be very difficult to store that and to find anything in terms of information or attachments in it.As we know, users are fond of emails. Some even use them too much.In 2016, 250 billion emails have been exchanged every day worldwide.In 2020, forecasts predict 258 billions.Do you imagine every day? 285 billions, it's quite a lot.We are going to see right now the best practices that we can have in Teams.To forget about emails and those time-consuming habits that we have.Our 10 collaboration best practices in Teams.Best practice No.1: I am ready to adopt Teams with my team. What are the best practices to encourage my team to adopt it? The best practice in Teams:You have first of all to specify the guidelines, how teams is used and why.The key is to specify the guidelines that are defined and how it is used and for what purpose. Microsoft Teams is much more intuitive than sending a message to several people with various attachments when brainstorming or collaborating. Be strict about the application of this rule. It may take a few weeks for people to get used to working this way. But once it becomes a habit, is a much more effective way of working.Avoid creating too many teams and channels. Just make sure you don't go crazy with the creation of tons of channels.If it's time-consuming to find information in our list of emails, it will be time-consuming as well to find information in a list of 100 channels.Set up a naming convention and classifications. Keep in mind that Microsoft Teams is intended for consistent collaboration: Chat, document, task within a collective group of people whether it's a department or project team.Naming convention and classifications to avoid language slippage, generic channel naming to avoid multiplicity.It will ease access to these documents, conversations and various information to new employees in the team.Then, second best practice:Dozens of messages are about the same topic.What's the best practice in Teams?To begin with, we have to centralize topics.Enable the real time collaboration.We have to create one channel for each project, we remove the unnecessary tabs.And manage the display of your favorite teams.Add important teams to favorites to find them back at the top of the teams.Hidden channels and teams: We have a project that is over but for some reason we have to go back on these teams to find information. Let's hide them.If we hide teams and channels, they are still here. They are not deleted, they are still in Teams but they will be hiddenat the bottom of our teams list. We can find them back, but at least it's way more organized.We can also archive teams with completed projects.When we are over with a team, everything is done, we do not need it anymore, we can archive it.This team will be in the archives. We not need to go back on it, but we archived it.Let's continue with the best practice No. 3:I often exchange messages with the same group of people.The best practice in Teams:Use team conversations, so you don't lose history.If you send emails or use Skype to send information, at a moment or another you are going to lose track of everything.In Skype and Outlook if you need to search for minutes and minutes to find information, it is not worth it.In Teams, you have a conversation feed, you just have to scroll up and scroll down to find information.You can also create new topics so other people can respond to them.You will save time to find the answer.You can create different topics and in the comments of these topics you will find the information. You can answer the existing topics by enriching them with GIF, emojis or stickers.It will enable quick exchange, showing notes or calendars and documents. With GIF, emojis and stickers, you can have more casual conversations, it will be more interesting to have some icons, etc.Convert a text exchange into a face-to-face video meeting.You have a lot of information to transmit to your coworker.If you start to write the equivalent of a book in Teams, it will be difficult to find information or even to read all of it.You can create a face-to-face video meeting.You exchange information with your coworker, your partner and he is not on the side of this meeting so you can write important information and the less important one will only be in your mind.Let's continue with the best practice No. 4:I need to distinguish when I am copied in or when I am the main recipient of an action.The best practice in Teams: We are going to use mentions. In Teams, you can mention people by usign the @. They will receive notifications and the names will be in purple.This way people will know when they are the main recipient of an action.If there are only copied in, they can read it if they want to.To stay informed about new publications you can follow channels. It's possible in Teams to follow channels and to received notifications when there is a new publication.You will always be ready to received this new information.Mask those which do not concern you.In Teams you can mask channels. You will not hide them for everyone, only for you.In your current project in Teams there are tabs about the marketing but you don't work in marketing, it's not important for you. You can hide it and you will only find back the different channels that are interesting for you.Stay informed with the activity alerts.In the activity tabs in Teams, we will find all the alerts and notifications about things that concern you. When you follow a channel, when someone mentions you.You just have to go in the alerts and you will find the different notifications.Let's continue with the best practice No. 5:I regularly forward messages to inform people. The best practice in Teams: Use the wiki tab as a team logbook.If you have a lot of information or messages to forward to everyone every time, those people are on your Teams. Go on the Wiki tab.In it, you can put important formation.Instead of forwarding messages to the 10 same people everyday, go into Wiki.Put the important message here and those 10 people will be able to read it with one click: Less emails and quicker way to find information.You can also add a netbook to collect notes and knowledge. Create a team notebook and, like in Office 365 NoteBook or OneNote, you can add notes, knowledge, images, etc.You can put a link in a conversation to highlight a document.You have a document in your Teams library and you can take the link, put it in a conversation and everyone will access the document just by clicking on it.It is a quicker way to exchange and collaborate on a document.You can use tabs to access other services.In Teams you can add services in the tabs. There are a lot of different possible applications and you can also use social networks such as LinkedIn, Trello, Jira, etc.You can also put different documents in the tabs. You can ask contacts to send an email directly to the channel because it's possible in Teams to send an email to a specific email address and this email address is the Teams.In the channel, the email will appear as a normal message, a normal conversation.Let's continue with the best practice No. 6: I often send and receive emails to update documents and my storage quota is insufficient.You have your document, your coworkers update it, they send a new one. Then you update it, you send it back, etc. Then you have 10 attachments which are the same emails but updated each time.The best practice in Teams: Facilitate collaboration on documents. Document shared by Teams are stored in the document library of the associated SharePoint site. A SharePoint site is made to store documents, not like Outlook. A folder is created in the library for each channel. So in SharePoint you have a folder and this folder will be different for each channel.Folder for channel 1, channel 2, etc.Share files as links. You can use links to share documents.You share documents in one place, SharePoint for example,  and copy the sharing link to send it to someone.This person will not have to store it anywhere, it is just a link.You can work with several people on a document. You can co-edit documents open in Teams online or via the heavy client (the software on your computer). The version control is enabled by default for shared document. You can control different versions: In case there is any problem in a version, you can go back to the latest one.You can discuss while modifying. You can discuss with meetings directly in Teams or via a chat conversation open when you are editing a document and so you can discuss with your coworkers.Then, the best practice No. 7:I often send the same attachments.The best practice in teams: Customize your tabs to make it easier to access recurring files. You create a tab which is about a document and by clicking on it you will access it.Copy the link to a document to put it in a conversation. You copy the link, you go in the conversation, to the comment and you put the link here. Everybody will be able to access it.Add documents to the conversation instead of the Files tab if you want them to be seen. The Files tab is to store documents, but in the conversation, you send the document and everybody will see it directly.There is no need to go in the files library, it will be in the conversation.The best practice No. 8: I often look for information.In Teams, you can save important messages. By saving them, you can find them back easily.You can pin your conversations. You pin them and you will be able to find them back quicker.Use filters in activity flows. By using filters, you can find specific information quicker.Use the search engine and filters. If we know what we are looking for, by using the search engine and the filters we will take way less time than we do on Outlook for example.Best practice No. 9: I often waste time in meetings, I would like to be more efficient.The best practice in Teams: With Meet Now, you can easily and quickly switch from a conversation to an impromptu meeting.You can promote audio and video conferencing and you can record meetings to make them available to other team members who are absent.All of your meetings will be stored and you can send them to people who are not here.Best practice No. 10: During meetings, I share information with other people.Best practice in Teams: Share your screen, it's way easier to share information if people can see it.Set up a share notepad to co-publish the note-taking during meetings. If we have 10 people in the meeting, then 10 notepads and 10 notes to put in the same notepad would be too long. If we have only one notepad for 10 people and everybody can co-publish it, it will be easier and quicker and you can exchange information via conversation during the meeting.Then we have a bonus best practice: I often send attachment to people on the move.Best practice: Install the mobile application. Teams in on smartphone so you can take your Teams with you. With the mobile app you can find teams, channels, documents, conversation, and tabs directly on your smartphone. It's perfect when you are on the move.How to spread and share best practices?You have to rely on a network of ambassadors. Explain the meaning of the transformation.They will influence within teams, through informal conversation that will help knowledge to be disseminated and anchored more effectively. Learning through colleagues is one of the most effective and widely used methods.Reassure them: They will be scared because it's new, you have to reassure them. Since they have tested the tools, they will capitalize and accumulate experience to transform it into knowledge. Share their feedback on it.Then we have to raise awareness and train employees.Use the collaborative digital platform, it will offer an adapted training using concrete cases. Propose short training resources: Tutorial videos,use case scenarios, etc.Set up dedicated physical meetings. The purpose will be to enable continuous improvement in each entity to address cross-cutting issues such as local initiatives.Do not neglect knowledge building as it enables new practices to be anchored in habits over the long term.Coming soon: Courses about the best practices.In conclusion, Microsoft Teams is ideal for daily communication and collaboration within a department, project team or group of people working closely together with a common goal or deliverable. Outlook is for formal things. Use Teams for daily tasks.If you have any questions, you can ask them directly in the chat.For those who do not have questions, I thank you for being here today.

131615,en,Discovering Outlook Online,9.0,"Hello everyone and welcome to this training session about Outlook Online2and more specifically ""Discovering Outlook Online"". What can we do with it?3Beforehand we have some instructions4turn off call waiting,5think about muting your mics or else6everybody will be able to hear the noise behind you7and keep your screen active at all times.8If you let your computer go into sleep mode,9you'll be automatically disconnected from this training session.10So think of moving the mouse from time to time to remind the computer that you're still here.11If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask them.12Just call me by my name.13By the way, my name is Thomas14Just ask your question, it will be better if we have a real interaction during this training session.15Today we have 45 minutes to see how to login to the portal.16On the portal, how can we access Outlook Online?17We're going to see Outlook Web App,18Outlook Online, and what we can do on it.19Finally, we are going to see some little tips on Outlook to begin on it more easily.20The objective today is to discover the Outlook Web App interface.21I'm going to put it on the screen right now.22As you can see, I'm on on my online Office portal.23I can find all of my different applications and on the top left we have Outlook.24But also in case Outlook's not here,25you can click on the little online start menu, on the top left, the app launcher26and here is Outlook.27and if I click on ""All apps"" in the middle,28I will find all of the applications I have access to with my user profile.29And, on it, I easily find Outlook.30I clicked on it, and now Outlook is open on my screen.31Let's begin with the interface.32What is on Outlook and what can I use?33To begin with, on the top we have the ribbon.34On the ribbon, we can create a new email, calendar, event or group35and I can also mark all as read.36On the right, I have the ""Undo"" button37in case I've made a mistake for example, I marked as read.38I'll be able to undo it, for example I delete it, undo and it will be right back.39On the top right, we have ""The new Outlook"" functionality.40If I click on it, my interface will change a little.41As you can see, I have ""Empty folder"", ""Mark all as read"", ""Undo"", etc. on the top left.42And ""New message"" on the far left.43It's a different interface but we are not going to work on it today.44We're going to use the old Outlook.45Also on the left, I have the search menu.46I have my folders47and by clicking on something for example, ""Deleted Items"",48I can find all the emails I have deleted on my Outlook Online.49 Let's go back to the inbox.50I also have the search bar.51If I click on it,52I can search for an email from Amaury.53I found Amaury and by clicking on it54I will find all of the emails from him.55I can search in all folders,56in the inbox,57in the conversations, deleted items on in the groups.58From Amaury, Pierre, etc.59I also have different options.60Do I want to my email with attachment or not.61If I select it,62I only have one email from Amaury with an attachment.63I can also change the date.64Forever, this week, last week, etc.65I can also select a range.66If I click on other inbox, etc.67I will be on the other folders.68I can also search by subject69for example, the subject is Teams.70As you can see right here,71I have all of my emails that contain ""Teams"" in the subject.72But as you can see73in ""Alpha Project"", we do not have Teams in the subject.74If I click on it, Teams is directly in the email.75because Outlook is capable of looking for the title,76but it can also look for the subject (Teams)77directly in the body of the email.78Let's exit the search.79I also have the possibility to click on Oliver Lodge80and Groups81and I have all of my different folders and groups.82Because the Outlook groups are linked to Outlook83and I can find them here directly.84Now we are going to use a different things.85On the top, we have the Filter.86By clicking on Filter87I can filter by all of my emails,88the unread ones, etc.89Let's try the unread one.90Here, I can find all of my unread emails.91I can also close it92and filter once again93only the emails that are flagged.94I only have two of them, etc.95So it is just a quick filter.96I can also sort by date, from, to, subject, etc.97Let's sort by ""from"".98In here, I have ""Alpha Project""99then Amaury, etc.100By going at the bottom, I will have different people.101Let's wait a bit for it to load.102Here I have construction site, Dina, FindTime, etc.103So it will be in alphabetical order.104I can show as messages or conversations.105What's the difference?106Messages are simple emails.107Let's say you send an email: it will be in your sent box.108The the person answers: you will receive the answer and that's all.109But if you put in conversation mode,110every time someone answers an email,111by clicking on it, you will be able to see all of the conversation history112during the email exchange.113So instead of having different messages114you will only have one with all the different messages directly in it.115Then, let me show you the focused inbox.116I click on it and I have Focused and Other.117It's basically a filter directly in Outlook.118What is the difference between Focused and Other?119In Focused, you will find the important emails120from coworkers, recognized companies, etc.121In Other, you will emails that are not so important but aren't spams neither.122In Other I can find Amaury Sylvestre in Teams123because Amaury shared a document in Teams.124It's not a spam because it's interesting125but it's not a priority message.126So it will be in Other.127Outlook will learn what you do.128Let's say in Other, every time you read emails ""X in Teams""129and then you put it in Focused130and do that every time for a little while,131Outlook will understand that you want the emails from Teams in the Focused inbox.132Another example:133Alpha Project, every time you do not read them and just delete them,134after a while, it will directly go in Other135and in Other, if you delete all emails without reading them136they will go, after a while, in the spam inbox.137So Outlook will learn with what you do in your inbox.138Then we can right-click on an email and there are many possibilities.139I can reply to this email, reply to all the people in the email, and forward it to someone.140I can delete my email or archive it.141I can mark it as unread or flag it.142Mark as junk or ignore it.143Move to Other inbox,144always move to Other inbox.145So if you do not want to wait for Outlook to understand what you want to do146you can always move to Other inbox.147I can move to Other inbox148Steven, inbox, training, conversation, clutter, etc.149I can categorize. What is a category?150With the Categorize option151I have the possibility to put a little code on my email.152For example, let's go on it and click on ""Manage categories"" at the bottom.153Here, I can add a new category.154Let's call it ""Omega Project"".155By clicking on left on the little white square, I can select a color.156I will select the pink one.157Then I click on OK.158OK again.159Now, right-click on an email. Let's look for real email160Not an invitation.161Let's take this one.162Right-click, then categorize163and let's select Omega Project.164Now I have on the right, on my reading screen,165Omega Project with a pink rectangle.166I also have it in the inbox.167So by using this, you can quickly find your emails.168And if you right-click, categorize, you can put multiple categories.169Categorize, yellow. I have 3 categories right here and 3 categories on the left as well.170In the filter, I can sort by... We do not have categories here171but if we want to we will be able to find them rather quickly172because of the different color code.173I can find my emails:174I know that pink is for Omega Project and without looking at it, I know it's Omega Project.175Let's continue with the right-click.176Here, I have ""Create rule"".177By clicking on it,178I will be able to create a new inbox rule.179Let's give it a name. Let's call it ""Quick move"".180Then I ask to look for specific conditions.181If I click on the first condition182I ask multiple things: it was sent or received,183includes these words, my name is, it's marked with,184Its size is within a specified range, it's received within a specified date span or apply to all messages.185Let's select ""It was sent or received"",186received from Amaury Sylvestre.187We already checked that.188""Do all of the following"".189I want to move it or I can pin it, mark it, forward it.190So I want to move it to the drafts.191""Add action"".192I want to mark the message with a category.193And I want the Blue category.194Then, ""Except if it matches any of these condition"": I can add exceptions.195For example, if it's marked with importance, let's say ""High"".196After this, either I stop processing more rules197or I can continue to process rules even if the emails have already been moved.198I click on OK.199From now on, every new email that I receive that matches those conditions200will automatically be sent to the Drafts folder on the left.201Right-click,202I can show in immersive reader.203If I click on it, my email is now in a specific reader.204Once again, right-click205""View message details"" or ""Assign policy"".206I can delete it after a specific time207for example, every year every email will be deleted as specified in the ""1 Year Delete"".208If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them.209Now, we're going to see how to create a new message.210If I want to create a new message211I go at the top in the ribbon, but because I selected a message212my ribbon has new features.213I can delete it, archive it, put it in the junk,214sweep it, I can move it to Other inbox,215categorize it, and with the ellipsis, I find the different possibilities that I had before.216Now, let's click on New to create a new email.217On the right, I have the place where I write the email,218I will send it to Amaury.219I can add a carbon copy220but also, on the top right I have ""Bcc""221and I can add the blank carbon copy,222which means that I will be able to send an email to someone as a copy223but the original recipient won't be able to see that I have added people in carbon copy.224I can add a subject, I will put ""Hello All!"".225and ""Please find..."".226In my email, at the bottom, I can change the format and the font.227For example, let's select that.228It will take a few seconds to load, let' select Century Gothic and it will change.229Put it in bold, italics, underline, highlight...230But also change the color of the font,231I can add bullets, numbering, etc. I have a lot of possibilities.232At the bottom I can send my email, discard it,233I can attach files from my computer or from a cloud location.234What is a cloud location?235If I want to, I can select a file from my SharePoint or OneDrive236and I will be able to send it directly here with a sharing link.237If I click on it238I have my files, I select ""Book 1"".239""Next"". It will ask me if I want to share it as a OneDrive link or attach as a copy.240If I attach it as a copy, it will be a copy241that I send to Amaury.242If he edits the document, it won't be edited for me243because it's only a copy.244But if I share it as a OneDrive link, Amaury will be able to edit the document245and this document will be edited for me as well because it's a shared document.246I can add pictures,247little emojis,248and share my availability.249If I click on it, I can select availability,250click on insert and say that I'm available today from 9 AM to nearly 12 PM.251Then I can choose to have the formatting options or not.252And with the little arrow, I can save as a draft, insert my signature,253show from, check names, set importance, switch to plain text,254shows message options and check for accessibility issues.255If I click on ""Show message options""256I can request a delivery receipt,257I can request a read receipt,258encrypt this message, digitally sign this message or add sensitivity.259I cancel it but if I want to I can send it260which I won't do here because it's only a demonstration.261Now we're going to use some of the options in the parameters of Outlook.262On the top right, there is a little cog.263If I click on it, different parameters and options appear.264To begin with, on the top, I have ""Automatic replies"".265By clicking on it, I can create an automatic reply for when I'm out of the office.266I click on ""Send automatic replies"".267I can either send them whenever, beginning right now268or I can send replies only during this time period.269Let's check that.270Start date: today at 6 PM271to the 15th at 9 AM.272I can block my calendar for this period, let's do that,273and the title will be ""On vacation"".274I can automatically decline new invitations occurring during this period275and decline and cancel my meetings during this period, let's do that as well.276Select which message to use when declining or canceling events during the period.277So I can create a message if I want to.278I can use a reply for people inside or outside my organization or create a message to include the reply.279At the bottom I can add the message that will be automatically sent to people who send me emails.280""Hii, I'm away for a few days. Please leave or contact Pierre Skolil for any request. Thanks""281I can also send automatic reply messages to senders outside my organization.282If I check I will have to create a new message.283I click on OK at the top left. From this evening at 6 PM until the 15th at 9 AM284I won't be available and my meetings will be canceled, etc.285Let's close this.286There are other options, but the one I want is not here.287In ""Search all settings"", I can put for example, ""signature"".288As you can see, ""Email signature"" is right here.289Here. I can choose to write my signature.290By default it's ""Best regards, Oliver"".291I can automatically include my signature on new messages I compose292or automatically include my signature on messages I forward or reply to.293I create my signature and click on OK.294Now if I create a new email I see ""Best regards, Oliver"" with the signature.295Let's continue.296Now we have the display settings.297It is what I want my interface to look like.298For the Reading pane: on the right, at the bottom or hide it.299But also for the message list:300choose how to display your messages, sender name or subject first301show preview text or hide it.302I have different display settings. I won't go through all of them303because it is how you want them to be so it's not specific parameters,304it is only what you want to do, and what you want to add directly in Outlook.305I will let you check on that yourself.306At the bottom, I can change my theme.307You have the little construction bricks and if I click on that308at the top I have construction bricks, etc.309I click on some of them and it will automatically change.310Let's change to the one I had before,311Let's say a light blue, it's good.312I choose it, I save.313And now everything changes to light blue:314on top of the ribbon, the little marker in the inbox or even my emails315an even my text on the right.316Everything changed from dark blue to light blue. If I select dark orange,317everything is dark orange now.318So it's a quick way to change my display.319Let's go back to our PowerPoint.320Today we saw the portal, portal.office.com,321and the online Start menu with all my apps here.322In Outlook we looked at the file explorer323and with the right-click I can enable all of the possible actions.324The cog icon is for the settings.325If you have any questions right now, do not hesitate to ask them.326If you don't have questions, I thank you for being here today with me.327Make good use of it.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],1576.0,webcast

What does it do?24Then we will see what happens when we are logged into the Office 365 portal.25Then, we will see the difference between OneDrive and SharePoint.26Finally, the Office Online package: Excel, PowerPoint, Word and OneNote.27The objective today is to discover the Office Online interface.28Let's begin with the Cloud computing basics.29We can have a computer, a laptop, a tablet and a smartphone.30On all of those different devices, we will have access to Office.31On a laptop and computer, we will have the online Office package.32On a tablet, we will have the Office web apps.33And on a smartphone, we will have the Office mobile applications.34Office 365 will group: Exchange, for professional mailbox,35SharePoint, for document sharing,36and the Lync system (Skype and Teams), for HD video and web conferencing.37What's the use of Cloud computing basics?38Its Accessibility.39Wherever I am and whenever I want, I will have access to Office and the applications.40The compatibility.41With Office 365, you can open documents that are older than the current version.42If you have the 2019 version, you can open a 2007 version document.43Security.44It's hosted on Microsoft servers and they are very secure.45The serenity.46You won't have to stress out for your information or documents because it will be very easy to find them.47Now that we have seen how Cloud computing basics work,48let's talk about the portal49portal.office.com50that we will access in a few minutes.51So on, we will find our different applications52and the online start menu.53And on it we will find all out apps.54I will open the online portal on the screen.55On it, we will have our different applications.56Outlook, OneDrive, Word, etc.57All of our apps.58On the top right, you have ""Install Office"".59If you want, you can install the software directly on your computer.60If you don't want to go on the online version, you can have the desktop version.61We have the documents.62Here we have the recommended documents.63What does it mean? It is the document I have access to64but they may have been shared with other people or with me65and they've been edited recently66so I can open them and see the modifications.67Then we also have the documents, the shared documents,68the recently shared documents,69the pinned documents,70the documents that are shared with me71and the documents that I've never seen at that I can discover.72To pin a document, it is very simple.73We have ""Demo 2019"" here,74I click on the little pin75and if I go in Pinned, we have ""Demo 2019"" here.76At the bottom, we have a OneDrive and a SharePoint folder.77In OneDrive, we will find the recent folders created or edited.78In SharePoint, I will find the frequent sites that I've consulted and the sites that I'm following.79For both of them I can go directly to the app: ""Go to OneDrive"", ""Go to SharePoint"".80On the top left, we have the online start menu.81In it, I will find some applications.82If I click on ""All apps"" in the middle, I will find all of

open"" and ""New"".87From the Office 365 front page, I can directly create or upload documents:88Word document, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Forms and Sway.89With a single click, I can create a new document.90Now let's click on the little cog on the top right: ""Settings"".91In the settings, I will be able to edit themes.92I have the light blue, but I can use the Office themes, dark blue, rainbow, etc.93I have a lot of them to edit my front page with the one I like.94I clicked on ""View all"" and I have a lot of them.95Let's keep the default one.96After it we have ""Language and time

menu.106If I click on my own picture107I can access my profile and my account.108In my profile, let's wait for it to load...109I will be directly on an application called Delve.110We won't talk much about Delve because it's not the topic of the session111but you will find are all the information about you and your coworkers112and you will be able to update your profile.113You can see ""Contact information"",114""About me"", ""me in a few words"", different projects, ""Skills and expertise"",115projects I'm working on, ""School and education"", ""Interests and hobbies"".116Let's continue with My account.117In my account, I will have a lot of different tabs.118My account, Personal info, Subscriptions, Security & privacy, etc.119We won't go into all of them, but in the account I have a lot of information, a lot of things that I can change and edit.120Let's go back to our portal.121I will click on the online start menu122and we'll talk about OneDrive and SharePoint.123Let's go back on it.124What's the difference between OneDrive and SharePoint?125First of all, let's look at OneDrive.126OneDrive is a personal online storage space.127This means that you can put all of your documents, or the one you want, in OneDrive.128By doing it, you will be able to find them whenever you want.129For example, you are at work on your computer130and you put your important documents on OneDrive.131You come back on the following morning132and surprise, your computer had a problem during the night, it's not working anymore, the hard drive is broken.133So it's not usable, you lost all of your information and documents.134If you go on OneDrive with other computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.135you will find all of the documents you put here136because it's online, it's secure, and so you won't lose your document whatever happens to your devices.137It's not linked directly to your devices: if it's broken, OneDrive is OK.138So OneDrive is more personal.139You put your document in it: it is for you and only you, with some possibilities to share it with coworkers,140but with very small teams.141You can, but it's not a good idea, share your documents on OneDrive with hundreds of persons.142It's better to share it with a few people.143We also have SharePoint.144SharePoint is the opposite of OneDrive145OneDrive: small teams, a bit of sharing, but it's mostly for me.146SharePoint is to work as a team.147You will have a SharePoint site148And in the SharePoint site, you will have documents.149Those documents will be available for all members of this site.150It can be 3 persons or several hundreds.151So OneDrive is more personal and SharePoint is to share with a lot of people.152OneDrive is only for storage and sharing153and SharePoint is like a website for your team.154We will see that in a few seconds.155Let's click on OneDrive to begin with.156On OneDrive I have different folders and files.157Quite simply, I can click on ""New"", on the top, to add a folder or document.158I can click on ""Upload"" to upload files and folders.159And we have ""Sync"".160""Sync"" is also called synchronization.161Synchronization is to link your online OneDrive with your computer162but don't worry, even if your computer has a problem, your OneDrive won't have a problem even if you are linked/synchronized.163It means that you can have a folder on your computer which is directly synchronized with OneDrive online.164You put a document in it, it will appear on OneDrive online.165You put a document in OneDrive online, it will appear in your folder on your desktop.166It is the same if you delete or edit documents.167It will be a link between the online and the desktop.168Everything you do on one side will affect the other side.169Quickly, let's click on ""New"" to create a new folder for example.170Let's call it ""Omega Project"".171We have the Omega project right here.172I click on it to open it.173""Files"", ""New"", let's create a simple Word document.174A new tab is opening.175In here, I have Word online.176I can write whatever I want,177I close it,178and here I have Document.docx.179Right-click, ""Rename""180and let's call it ""Important info"".181Let's save it.182I have my document right here.183It's quick, it's simple and it's quite easy.184This is OneDrive.185This is a training session that will only deal with OneDrive and SharePoint.186Let's close OneDrive and go to SharePoint.187SharePoint is quite different from OneDrive.188First of all we have different sites, news from sites, frequent sites and suggested sites.189As I said before, on SharePoint we will have little websites.190On those sites, we will be able to do whatever we want.191hide information, get information, add documents, etc.192On the top left, I click on ""Create site"" to create a new site.193But for now, let's go in Project Alpha in Frequent sites.194Once again, it's quite different from OneDrive.195It's not a file library, we have one on the right,196but it's like a web page.197I won't go in further details198but by clicking on ""Edit"", we are able to edit the page, to add information and documents.199We can add web parts and I have a lot of them.200So we can edit our SharePoint site to look like whatever we want.201So we can create our own little website directly in SharePoint.202On the left, one of the tabs is named ""Documents"".203I click on it.204Here I will find all my documents. I only have one folder.205All the documents I have here, it's the same: Word, Excel, etc.206All the documents I have here will be shared automatically,207it is very important,208with all members of this SharePoint site.209If I look on the top right, I have 2 members:210Oliver and Stephen.211By default, whenever I add a document here, because I am using the Oliver Lodge training profile,212all documents will be available for Steven by default.213I can check on other sites as well.214If I go on ""Test Team 101"",215let's wait a few seconds for it to load,216I have 5 members: Maxime, Pierre, Amaury, Oliver and Lisa.217By default, if any document in here, they will have access to all of them.218Like this, I can share documents with a large number of people219inside or outside my company.220On SharePoint and OneDrive, you can share document with people outside your company.221On SharePoint, you can add members that are colleagues from another company,222people are working closely with us.223We can add them in SharePoint, even customers if we want to.224With OneDrive and SharePoint, we have the ability to share documents without problems.225Let's close OneDrive and SharePoint.226We have one last thing to see.227It is Office online package: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.228As I said before, you don't need to have them installed on your computer to use them.229Directly from the online version, from the online portal230you can use them.231Let's begin with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.232We will see what they use.233First of all, we have Microsoft Word online.234Microsoft Word Online is to write documents.235I can choose a template for my document: Open house flyer, 5-day trip planner, etc.236I will be able to find all my recent Word documents,237my pinned documents, Word documents that are shared with me238and the documents that I have to discover.239Let's click on ""New blank document"".240Here, I will be able to write whatever I want because it's Word.241The important thing to know is that the online version of Word has less features than the desktop version.242because online it is not possible to have exactly the same features.243It's the case for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.244I will only have some features but they are the most important ones.245On the top we have a lot of tabs with a lot of possibilities anyway.246An important thing is that if I write anything, on the top you see ""Document 2 - Saving"".247If I stop writing for a few seconds, it's finally saved as you can see248It means that I don't have to save my documents manually.249If I want, I can write whatever I want,250I close the document251and in a matter of seconds I will retrieve my information.252Why is it so good?253Let's say you are working on a document on Office Online254and without a warning the electricity shuts off.255We don't have anymore electricity in the company and I was working on a computer,256not a laptop, and it was only working because it was plugged.257So my computer doesn't work anymore.258But my document is still OK259because it was saved automatically.260I don't have to stress out because I've been working on it for 3 hours and I did not save: it's OK.261You've lost the 3 or 4 last words but it's not the worst case possible.262Then we have Excel.263Excel works like Word.264I can use a template and Recent, Pinned, Shared with me and Discover (still on Word).265Template, Recommended, Recent, Pinned, etc.266I create a new workbook.267I think you already know Excel.268I have a soft online application269to use as a table.270As before, I can write whatever I want271and I will have all the features I need.272Once again, I have less features than on the desktop version.273But I still have the insert function button.274So it is quite easy to find what I want.275On PowerPoint online.276We have the same things as before.277What's the use of PowerPoint? It's to create presentations.278I have to present something to my co-workers, my customers, etc.279I can use PowerPoint.280I can add pictures, text, sound, videos, music, etc.281I will have many possibilities in PowerPoint to make it an interactive and interesting presentation.282Then we have OneNote online.283Maybe you don't know about it.284What's the use of OneNote?285Let's click on an existing notebook: ""OneNote 101"".286On OneNote we have a notebook287and then I will have different sections288and in those sections I will have pages.289I can give a name to these pages, let's call it ""test"".290And I can write whatever I want on it.291It's like a real notebook but online.292So I can write wherever I want, I can scribble on it.293If we go in ""Draw"",294I can scribble.295and I can also insert documents, pictures, videos, sound, etc.296It is like your paper notebook but online.297You can find it wherever you are by going on the online portal.298It's also possible to share this notebook.299If you share it with someone, this person will be able to go in your OneNote, your pages, your sections,300see the information that you add and will be able to add information as well,301simultaneously if you want to.302It's a quick wait to share information, after a meeting for example.303Let's go back to our PowerPoint.304OneDrive and SharePoint:305OneDrive is for files, tools and shared documents306and SharePoint is for synchronization of the file server in the company's Internet.307In Office Online we have Word for emails and long documents creation,308Excel for calculation, showing value results, data management and analysis,309PowerPoint, the presentation maker,310and OneNote that we saw before.311A summary of all of this:312makes remote working easier,313provides access at any time,314enables document modification with several people315at different times and simultaneously.316If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them right now.317If you do not, I thank you for being here today.318Make a good use of what you learned today.319Have a good day.

148380,en,Discover the note taking app,29.0,"Hello everyone,Welcome to this online session called:Discover the Note Taking App: OneNote.My name is Dina and I will be your trainer today.First be advisedthat this webinar is being recorded andyou will have the opportunity to view itsoon after on our MOOC platform.And now, before I start the presentationand in order to ensure that it runs smoothly, it is important you listen to the followinginstructions carefully.The first one is: If you're using a phone, please do nottake call waiting or a second call asthe music on hold will start playing andwe will no longer be able to hear oneanother. The second one is: On your endmake sure to turn the microphone off byswitching the button to the mute mode.As you may all know, some of you may beworking in an open space environment; Sothose are really just cautionarymeasures to avoid unpredictable orunwanted background noise.The third and last one is: Please remember to keep yourcomputer screen active at all times bywiggling the mouse every now and then.  Itis very important you do not let your PCgo into sleep mode as this will causethe interruption of the video and youwill find yourself kicked out of thisonline session.  The inconvenience here isthat you will have to repeat the loginsteps all over again to get back in it!So let's avoid that!  All right.  First ofall, I've been using OneNote for almost ayear now. It has become my favorite tool.  I useit in my personal and my work life. It isa very user-friendly application andthis is why I find it very neat! So now,this is what we're going to cover overthe 45-minute session: The idea beingthat we are going to create a brand newwhat is OneNote and we'll seewhat it can do; Then after creating thatorganize it into different sections; Weare going to use the search feature withthe tag action items as to create ""To-Do""lists and prioritize those actions aswell.  And then, we are going to see how tostore securely this OneNote notebook inour OneDrive. The idea is to be able touse the application fully and so it isbest to learn how to save your notes inthe Cloud space so you can access fromany device; and also, to share thiscolleagues or friends... or family members... And collaborate on those notes together.So the objectives here are to discoverhow to centralize our notes with onesingle tool and to efficiently use theapplication's features and other tools.Now, let's begin! So what is ""OneNote""? Itbasically is your very own digitalideas a million things to do or amillion things to remember...  Well,OneNote is the perfect app for capturingpretty much everything. In technicalterms: It is a computer program forfree-form information gathering andmulti-user collaboration.  It can also gatherusers' notes (whether they arehandwritten or typed) drawings, screenclippings and audio commentaries. At thesame time, notes can be shared with otherOneNote users over the internet or aspecific network.  So what can you do withOneNote? Well, you can do the following:You can type or dictate notes... and/or recordaudio on your laptop, for instance.You can also sketch or write ideas onyour tablet; Add pictures from your phoneor find notes instantly; You can freelymove those notes around the page whichis very convenient; And you can organizethose pages into sections and keep yoursections in one or more notebooks. Butmost of all, you can switch devices andpick up right where you left off and ofcourse, share your notebooks with others; This way you can all view and contribute atthe same time, on the same items. Allright... So let's start using OneNote! Firstof all, it has a consistent interfacethat works the same on Windows Mac iOSand Android. You can sign in with yourpersonal Microsoft account or theaccount you use for work or school. Andthis is the part where I'm going tolaunch my Google Chrome browser to show you how to sign in to your Microsoftaccount. So I'm going to go right ahead andclick on Show Taskbar...  And at the bottom,I can locate my Google Chrome browser. I'm going to launch the page and under theGoogle search bar,  I'm going to just type in""Office 365""... and here you go... ""Office 365Login | Microsoft Office"" is the link Iwant.  I select it.  I'm going to sign inwith a ""Demo account"" under the name ofOliver Lodge.  I'm going to validate thispassword right now... And yes, I wish tostay signed in!  Now that I am in myMicrosoft account, on the upper rightcorner, appears the initials ""O.L."" forOliver Lodge as an avatar, my help button,my star wheel (if I wish to adjust thesettings) the notifications button... Andthen, on the far left, I can go to my ""AppLaunch"".  I can launch my OneNote from here or Ican just go to the tiles locatedhorizontally, on the main page. And I'mgoing to click on OneNote. Once I'm here,there's a purple button ""+ Newcreate a new notebook but we're going to dothis with the OneNote 2016 version on mydesktop, so I'm not going to click on that.Under the ""Recent"", right here, I can seethe recent activity... All the notebooksthat were open recently by Oliver Lodge...Under the ""Pinned"", his favorite notebook...Under ""My notebooks"", all the notebooks hecreated himself; he's the author of thesewith him; and then under ""Discover"", thoseare just suggestions... So I'm going to goback to the pinned one and I'm going tolaunch that one notebook online: ""trainer@teachoip"".The title will appearat the center, on top... Right there!  Andalso the author name again with the nameof that notebook.  I can also see the nameof the notebook, right here.  This is your""More Notebooks"" suggestions, ones I'verecently opened; I can see more notebooksby clicking at the bottom which takes meto a page with others suggestedI'm going to close this tab back... I'mgoing back to my notebookSo we saw we could see other notebooksfrom here, we can click back on thelayout is different from the regularinterface we had on OneNote 2016, on ourdesktop; The only difference is thesections are laid out vertically on thefar left with the ""+ Section"" buttonappearing at the bottom, here... And the""+ Pages"" right next to it, with thatvertical pane, as well...  And then the whitearea would be the page content.So you have your ribbon appearing on thefar right, as usual online all yourapplications when you open them theaccount user name appears on the topright: Oliver Lodge with the share button andthe notification button. So... if we were tolook at this ribbon, automatically we areon our ""Home"" tab. ""Home"" tab is where most of the used commands appear... So we haveour ""Undo"" / ""Redo"" button, the ""Clipboard"" the formatting group items up to here... Withdifferent ""Styles"" offered for the ""Heading""the ""Title"", ""Citations"" and so on... You gotyour ""Tags"" button and your spell check andthe ""Dictation"" button (which does notexist on OneNote 2016)... The version onlinehas it; And the latest Windows 10version of OneNote has it, as well.  Soagain, OneNote 2016 will no longer beupdated; Microsoft decided to come upwith a new version that resembles theone online. Except that I like bothversions.  And mainly... OneNote 2016, for me,is more inclusive...  But there are newfeatures in the version online andWindows 10 that I like; So, I chose todownload both versions and pin them bothto my taskbar so that I can swap back andforth when needed. So, let's continue!  If Igo to the file, I get to the backstage ofOneNote and there, are four tabs: I canprint from here, I can share with otherpeople by clicking on the ""Share"" buttonhere, online... And of course, you canstill insert you know: tables, files,pictures, links, even an ""Audio"" of youremojis and your ""Meeting Details"", as well...with stickers.  You can draw and here arethe tools to draw with...  And we'll getback to those features on OneNote 2016.So let me get back to the ""Home"" page...Let me start by selecting a new section inthis notebook.  So, I'm just going to create anew one real fast, for the online version...So ""New 400"" appeared right here and I seethis color has been used already... So I'mgoing to pick a new one... Uhm...  Section color...  Let'sgo with orange!  All right.  So ""New 400"" ishere.  Let's say I wanted to be rightunder ""Quick Notes""... So, it's now appearingat the bottom...  And automatically, when youcreate a new section, you will noticethere's a new ""Untitled Page""that automatically appears.  So, I'm going to press on that""+ Page"" and add more pages, if I want to...And then, I'm going to go here... And this page,I'm just going to give it the title""Dictation"" because this is the firstfeature I want to use; I'm going to""Dictate"" button on the far right.  I'mgoing to adjust the language to ""English(US)"".   I'm going to click on that button and assoon as I do that, the machine will starttyping for me... ""Anything I say, will appearon this page... I'm trying to create aparagraph so that I can demonstrate thenext feature which is called the""Immersive Reader, period."" And there youhave it.  I have a whole text, I'm going topress here.So, I deactivated the microphone.  Now ofcourse, I can use any of those featuresright here for formatting; I could alsochange the font if I wanted to...  I can usethe format painter and copy it over toanother line if I wanted to... There, youhave it!And I can increase the indentation, I canadd spaces between lines, just like youwould in Microsoft Word.  I'm going to undothis part and I can highlight all ofthat and clear the formatting instantly.So now, we are going to see, as well... theother feature is under the ""View"" tab.I'm going to the ""Immersive Reader"" and thisis pretty amazing!First of all you can adjust how theOneNote is going to read your text inthat page.  You can adjust the voice speed.You can choose a ""Male"" voice instead, ifyou prefer...  And then, you can press ""Play"".So you can't hear it because I'm doingthis presentation online...  I cannot shareboth audios, unfortunately!  Obviously, Ipicked the speed that was too fast...  It isa male voice that's reading aloud thewords that were highlighted just beforeyou, at that level...  So, I can go back andadjust it to being one and I can alsoadjust the text, if I want to read at thesame time...  I want to put that text.  Well,this size, should do!  And then, I can increasethe spacing between the words, if Iwanted to...  I can change the font fromthis to ""Calibri"" or ""Sitka"", again...  And Ican change the ""Themes""...  The background isnow yellow...  It's offering me more colorsover here.So the ""Grammar"" options, it can highlightthe ""Verbs"" in a different color.  So let'sactivate this portion...  So now you can seeany verb is highlighted in red. Now I cango to the ""Reading Preferences"".  I canfocus three lines at a time, if I wantedto...  Or just one line at a time...  And goback to this one, if I want to see the wholeparagraph...  And I can instantly change andtranslate this paragraph to Spanish.Let's say so...  Oops!  I went too fast.Going back to ""Spanish from Spain""... and I'mgoing to click on document,right here.  So Imade those adjustments and now I canpress the ""Play"" button.""Haga clic en ese boton y tan pronto como...""Now, I don't speak Spanish too well.But I'm trying to repeat what I justheard...  What you couldn't hear! But this isa fantastic way to improve language learning skills...  Not only you can translate your textinstantly but then you can practice howyou enunciate those words by selectingthe language of a native speaker...  Even ifit's a robot that's speaking, it'sactually very close to the real thing! Sothis is why I love this ""Dictation"" buttonand the ""Immersive Reader"".  So I'm going togo back.  We're done with the onlineversion! The other thing I could show youhere, (real fast) is wherever you're typingmanually...  I can type over here...  Or overhere...  I'm putting some gibberish items...Basically, you notice I have now fourmodules that I can also resize, if Iwanted to...  I can move them around likemagnets on a fridge, so that's veryconvenient! I've just copied one over(real fast) here...  So I can movethem around anyway I want and each ofthose modules of course, I can highlightand change the formatting, as I go along.So that's also very practical.  You canfreely move your notes around the page!So let me go back now to my ""Taskbar""... This is to  show you those are the two iconsI have; If I hover over this one: 'OneNote'is the latest version, the one you haveonline; And then ""OneNote 2016"" is theolder version but this is the one we'regoing to work with because it has far morefeatures, as well.  So let me launchOneNote 2016. Right away, you see that theribbon is far larger on the upper rightside.  You have the option of collapsingthe ribbon if you want; You can alsohide that ribbon; You can bring it back byshowing just the tabs or you can bringit back the way it was (with the commands)and then, you can go to the file section.That's the backstage to your OneNote. Yousee...  You have far more tabs around here.You can open a ""New"" notebook fromhere...  ""Open"" existing ones...  You can print...  Soyou can have a ""Print Preview"", as well.From here, you can ""Share with People"", youcan ""Share with Meeting"", ""Move"" notebooksand you can also export a ""Page"" of yourOutlook...  ""Send as Attachment""...  ""Send as PDF""...  ""Send to Word"", straight to Word docwith the contents of any page you filledin... Then you can also ""Send to Blog"".  Thishere, the ""Account"", is where you would doyour ""Office Updates"".  Now, be very careful!The last update I did, took away myOneNote 2016 and left me with a newversion without warning me...  But if you dogo to the Microsoft Office Support page, youcan find the download for OneNote 2016again and you will recover all the stuffyou had before.  So I'm going back tothe ""Home"" page.You have your ""Clipboard"" section...  yourbasic text formatting with the ""Styles""...  Wewill see the ""Tags"" section and how toEmail a page and the ""Meeting Details"".Right now, as you see, this is still thesame notebook I've opened...It's called ""trainer @teachoip"".  Remember, Ihad added a section called ""New 400"".I added some pages. I called one: ""Dictation"".  Those are the notes I just took online...You can understandnow that anything I do... If I were toshare this notebook with anyone,provided that I have saved it under myCloud space, under my OneDrive: my""personal"" or my ""business"" OneDrive... Anyelement I'm sharing with someone else,any modification I'm doing on the onlineversion, or on the desktop, issynchronized in real time.  So you're notgoing to lose any of your elements; Even ifthe internet stopped, this is theonly time where the elements are notsynchronized.  Don't worry!  You just haveto wait for the Internet to get back andeverything will get synchronized againwith the elements online. Ok.  So now, wesaid we're going to create a ""Newdo that, I always like to show the topsection. Right over here, is your ""QuickAccess Toolbar""... Those are things I liketo put in, immediately: The ""Undo""/""Redo""...  The ""Print""...  The ""Print Preview""...My ""FavoriteHighlighter 1""...  And somewhere in here, there's a ""Screen Clipping""...  I can right-clickon any button I like...  And I can addto ""Quick Access Toolbar"".  And now, it'sappearing here.  Why do I like this button?Well, this is my presentation... Let's sayI just want to highlight this portionhere...  I can put it on this page and look!What's amazing about OneNote, it cansearch text within an image!  So if I wereto type ""consistent interface"" or even a wholesentence ...Do you notice that? Within a picture, Ijust did a screenshot of something on myPowerPoint and it recognizes the textinstantly!  ""consistent interface"" is nowhighlighted. So if I had that word orthat sentence in any of my sections orother notebooks, it would be displayed under this vertical pane.  The""Search"" engine is fantastic!  Now let'sgo ahead and create that fresh notebook.I'm now clicking on the drop-down menu,under this notebook called""traine@teachoip"" and I can click righthere to say add notebook.  Wait...  Iforgot to let you know about the ""Pinbetween all your notebooks.  If you needto work with all of them at the sametime.  You can click on any of them andswitch...  But if you wish to havefull view again, you just click back onthat pin...  And instead, now I'm just going to clickon ""Add Notebook"".  It's going to take me tothe ""New"" tab, instantly.  I have the optionof saving my notebook directly under myCloud space which would be the idealspot...  If I want to actually have afull use of my OneNote application.  But for this demonstration, I'm going tosave it under my desktop which is thelocal area of my PC, meaning that I canonly access that notebook with that samePC.  And then, we'll see how to move thatspace OneDrive.  So let me call this one""Dina Family Notebook 101"".  I'm going to press ""Create Notebook"".  So now...  There you have it!  The nameof my notebook appears here; Automatically, I have a ""New Section 1"".I'm going to create 5 more... Maybe, 6 willdo.  I go to the first one and I willcall it ""Shopping List"".  The next one I'llcall ""Gardening"".  The idea is that I willbe sharing a personal notebook with myfamily members as an example.  And then,""Vacation Ideas""...  Countries: ""Canada""... Pick anothercountry...  I wish to visit ""Mexico"" and awhole continent: ""Europe"". Okay.  So why did Icreate those sections? Well, first of all,I can move the sections aroundby a ""drag and drop"", no problem.  Now if Iwant to put more structure in myorganization, I should put all those""Vacation Ideas"" with my countries.  And here, Ican go to the far right of Europe, forinstance, right-click on Europe...  Go to""New Section Group"" and that new section group, I'll give it a name: ""Summer Family Vacation"".And then I can just take the section: ""Vacation Ideas ""...  Drag and drop itunderneath and go back. So vacation ideas...  I select ""Summer Family Vacation""...  It goesunderneath that...  ""Canada"" under that...""Mexico"" and ""Europe""...  So now I have asection which is called... Right here,underneath the title of ""Dina Family Notebook""...""Summer Family Vacation"".Underneath it, I got ""Vacation Ideas"",""Canada"", ""Mexico"", ""Europe"".  Each of those sections has an ""Untitled Page"".  Okay.  So Ihave organized my ""Summer Family Vacation"".  I'm going to go back.  Now let's work on that""Shopping List"" section...I wish to add more pagesto the ""Shopping List"", so let's add about6...  The first one, I'm going to call it...  Well,""Birthday Shopping List"".  Here, I'm going toright-click on the next oneand give it a name: ""Cake Ideas""...  And thisone, I will rename it ""Food""...  ""Beverages""...""Activities""...  And the last one, ""Budget"". Now, just to put a structure as well under my""Shopping List""...  As you see, I have ""Birthday Shopping List"", ""Cake Ideas"", ""Food"", ""Beverages"",""Activities""...  Well, these 4 things shouldgo under ""Birthday Shopping List"".  So Ican either go and highlight ""Cake Ideas"" and ""Make a Subpage""...  Or I can manuallydrag food to the right...  So now I have the4 items as a subgroup.  And you willnotice right here, I can expand or collapse my list... Thereyou go!  So this is one way to structureyour pages.  I'm going to go back underthose...  Under ""Cake Ideas"", I'm going to put ""FLAVORS""...  So ""Chocolate""...  ""Vanilla""...""Strawberries""...""Caramel"".  All right.  So I put some flavorsand now I'm going to the ""Food"" sectionI'm going to make quickly a list for ""Food""...""Pizza""...""Sandwiches""...   ""Popcorn""...  ""Popsicles""...  I'm running out of ideas...  So let memove on to ""Beverages"", and here we go ...Over here, I'm going to type ""Apple Juice""...""Orange Juice""... ""Lemonade"" and ""Soda"".  For the ""Activities"", I'll pick 2 things.  Well, a""DJ"" which I will let my son take care of...  And then a ""Clown"" for my seven-year-olddaughter, let's say...  So now that I haveput in the items under each category, Iwant to make a To-Do list.  So I caneither highlight the words and press the ""To Do Tag""...A check box automatically appears...  I canremove this check box by going againunder the ""Tags"" group and then, at the very bottom, I'm going to make this a shortcut...Add to ""Quick Access Toolbar"".  Here, on on the top-right corner, it appears.  So I can remove thistag and instead maybe customize it.  The point here is to put a general ""To Do Tag"".And then I can specify...  These 2 for instance are my actiontags.  I'm going to customize a tag, soI'll know from this list which items Iam supposed to get.  So let me go to thenew tag, I'm going to type in a ""#""...Let me make sure I did this right...  ""#"" (hashtag"")...  Here we go...""Dina""... ""Actions""... (""# Dina Actions""), we'll call that one.  And then here,I'll just change the ""Tag"" and put a ""Star""instead...  And make it ""bright green"" so I canlocate it faster!All right.  There you go.  Now these2 items that I highlighted,I'm going to change them to beexactly my data actions tag...  So now I cando this for the ""Beverages"" or for the""Activities""...  Let's say I'm getting the""Clown""...""#Dina Actions""...  There you go.Oops.  Let me undo this.Let's do first a regular ""To Do Tag"".And then, I will specify that the ""Clown""...I'm going to take care of him...  And then,the beverages...  Let's say I'm in charge ofthe ""Lemonade""... Oops.  Again I keepforgetting the regular ""To Do Tag"" for everyone.And for me, I'm going to add a special ""Tag""to remember to get those items, myself.There you go.  So the whole idea here isto be able to do a quick ""Find Tags"" search.All right.  So before you...  It took afew seconds for all my notebooks tosynchronize since I have 3applications open: the one online, theversion that I have opened right now andthe Windows 10.  So ""#Dina Actions"" appearon top again because I put the ""hashtag""before my ""name""... Now, it appears on the verytop of the list, up here!  So it's showing""#Dina Actions"" first...  Then it's showing thecategory ""To Do"" which is the othercategory for the rest of the membersof the family...  All the other items thatstill need to be purchased by them.Here, I could have filtered my ""Search""with these different possibilities...  Andif it doesn't work right away, you alwayshave the ""Refresh Results"" button.Remember, it's a matter of letting the notebook synchronize first.And then, the convenient part is thatI can ""Create Summary Page"".  Now theother cool thing is for each of those items, Icould also add an ""Outlook Tasks""...  But I'mgoing to put first...  ""Apple Juice""...I'm going to set that for ""Tomorrow""...The ""Strawberries"" for ""This Week""...  The ""DJ""for ""Next Week""...  But I also have now thepossibility of opening these tasks inOutlook.  So let's say, for the ""DJ"", I wantmy husband or I'm sorry my son to takecare of that...  So ""Subject:""...  ""DJ""...  I can forwardthis task or assign this task to my son...Let's say his name is ""Philippe"", just forthe purpose of this presentation...  And Imake sure it kicks in...  Why isn't itkicking in? He should be in the address-book...Hold on...  So of course I'm using a ""Demo""name again...  So, here we go.  Well, It took a fewseconds...  All right.  Now I can assign thisparticular task to ""Philippe Houyau""...  I cansee the status for this task andfollow the progress of thistask...  So I can include a due date, I canalso adjust the priority  to ""HighImportance""... And then just sendthat message to ""Philippe Houyau"".  This isone way.  The other way,  I could havetaken this list of items and email it to myself...  So nowwhen I click on that ""Email Page"" iconon the ribbon, up here...Okay.  It took a few seconds...See, the list appears within the textarea of the email...  And now, I could just sendit to my personal email, for instance.All right.  So now: ""#Dina Actions""... I send thislist to myself.  So this way when I get it,I can start purchasing those items and Ican check them off as I go along.All right.  Or I could have just simplydownloaded the OneNote App on my phoneor my tablet, and then check off directly theitems from there.  That's anotherway...  I'm not going to send this.  That wasjust to demonstrate...  I'm going to close this.Now back to the OneNoteinterface...  You saw I can add ""Outlook Tasks"";I can open them within the Outlookapplication itself.  And now the other option, isthe ""Meeting Details""...  This is another thing we can add that actually has nothing to do withthe ""Shopping List""...   So let meopen a ""New Section""...  ""All the otherfeatures""...  Now I'm just going to show you...  IfI were using this professionally, I couldgo to the ""Meeting Details""...  So I alreadyprogrammed a meeting where I sent theinvite to my colleagues... I'm going tolocate that invite...  It was meant to befor tomorrow and it's called ""BusinessTravel Procedures"".  That's the one.  I caninsert the details that I sent to themwhich was an email basically saying""Hello everyone...""  First I locatethe email...  So those are the email details...Here, I have the list of the participantswhich basically shows the people I'veinvited in my email...I have sent them 2 attachments and asmall text which is...  ""Our MeetingObjectives""...  If I click here, I go straightto that email invite...  And I can see thedetails within that email...  And there, yougo!  You can see the people I've invited...(who appeared on the list of participants)...  I can checkthem off the day of the meeting andbasically, the text with a print screen.All right.  So this is what's so coolabout the ""Meeting Details""...  It's actuallysomething that you can locate in yourOutlook.  Now, I'm going to show my Taskbar...Let's open it up!Okay so back to normal...  I've launchedmy Outlook and this is the""OneNote"" button that I wanted to show you.I could click on this button fromOutlook and decide to add the details of an email message within OneNote.  So here it says to ""Pick asection or a page in which to put thee-mail""...  I could then go to my notebook,""All the other features"" and I can pick thatsection...  And as you see, under my ""All theother features"" section, it added the email message I selected from my Outlook inbox within my notebook,under the section I wanted.  So this iswhat you can do with Outlook, as well.Let me go back to Outlook.So I'm on the section ""All the other features"".I'm going to addanother page.  Let's put a few more...   So nowlet's go to the ""Sketching"" part.First, I can insert a file...  So letme go ahead and insert a PowerPoint file...Let's see... It would be under my ""DemoUploads""...  Which one should I take?""Snapshot Calendar..."" is a word.doc...  Well, let's startwith the Word.doc first beforeI go to the PowerPoint.  What you haveto understand is that OneNote isintegrated with the Office Suite and itworks beautifully with Word, PowerPoint,and Excel.  You can also insert PDF orwhatever web apps...  So let me go and approvethis date...  Press okay...  So this is a calendarsnapshot that I'm incorporating into myOneNote... I should have closed the other apps, Ithink I have too many things open...  Okay.So, the snapshot appeared...  You see...The printout instantly came into to myOneNote...  Let me close theseother panes right now.  All right.  So nowif I want to start drawing on thispicture, let's say...  As you can see, youhave the ""Lasso Select"",  the ""Panning Hand"", the ""Eraser""...And a choice of ""Highlighters and Pens""...I can also change the color andthickness by clicking here... Let mestart  with this ""red pen""...  Let's sayI want to mark some calendar dates withan ""X""...  Here, I can write ""vacation""...  I'm goingto handwrite which is not very easyto do with the mouse(instead of a digital pen)...  So let's dothis and see if it will recognize theword...  Okay.  Here it goes.You will notice on the ribbon,on the far right, it will switch ""Ink toText""...  And there you go.   I'm going to press""Escape"" for a minute... The word ""vacation""just appeared and it's amazing!  I canalso go back to my handwritten note andif I asked the ""Search"" engine over hereto locate any word or ""vacation"" on allIt will locate it... And it tells me right away...Well,  the ""Summer family Vacation""tab has the word vacationin it...  But it's also highlighting (righthere) the handwritten word ""vacation"".  So the search field recognizes texton images, handwritten text, as well.  Thisis how powerful OneNote search engine is!That's that as far as the ""Sketching and Drawing"" are concerned.  Now if I want to use theeraser I can quickly erase that way.  Let'ssay I started scribbling over here, withthis ""green pen""...  All right.  So I could do an""x"" and a ""y"" here...  Now I can use the insert""Insert Space"" to move objects...  So I've moved the ""X""without disturbing the space between""vacation"" and ""X""...  You could do that again.So this is another possibility. And now,back to the ""Insert"" tab...  Let me go to another""Untitled Page""...All Right. PowerPoint...  So you can alsoinsert the printout of a PowerPoint presentation.Let me do this and see the difference.  Let's pick ""Currency symbols"" and ""Insert Printout"".So now there's the printout of all theslides in that PowerPoint.  The otherthing you can do is the ""Audio"" portion.So I can go to my ribbon, I can ""RecordAudio"" or I can ""Record Video"".  Of courseyou won't be able to hear back theaudio but let me demonstrate...  So this iswhat the icon appears like...  I can typeanything I want and then I can press""Stop""...  Whatever I just said while I was typing...I can see the playback and hear it sowhen I press...(Sorry, I have to select it)...When I press ""Play"", I can hear myself...  Andanything that's highlighted in grey, it'srepeating what I've typed... So that sums upthe audio portion.  And now, I can alsogo back to my ""Insert"" tab...  I can also goto a browser, for instance..  Well, of course,you can add pictures and so on...  We'veseen the ""Screen Clipping"" earlier...  But I'mgoing to go to my browser, go to a YouTubepage and just select a video.So YouTube...  Let me type ""OneNote""... Let'spick this one...  I have to let the ad run firstI think...  In the meantime, I'mselecting ""Share""...  Then ""Copy"" the link and thenI'm going back to my OneNote again topaste that link.  Sorry, I'm havingtrouble with my mouse...  And so, I copypaste the link and I have the option toplay the video right from here, in that screen size...I won't be able to view it in full-size from here...But if I choose to, I can just click onthe link to get back to the browser andwatch the video on YouTube, itself.That's for the audio and inserting avideo within OneNote.  Now if I wantedto share this notebook with other people...I could press ""Share with People"" and I cantype in the name of any people I want...Well, I've done it earlier...  So ""Maxime Démo""...  I am already sharingwith ""Maxime Démo""...  I am also sharing with""Oliver Lodge"" and ""Laurent Balardy"" and asyou can see, ""Maxime Démo"" is an owner... ""OliverLodge"" is also an owner... And ""Laurent Balardy""can edit.  So those are thepermissions I granted.  I can write apersonal message before sending the linkto them... And over here, I can switch between""Can Edit"" and ""Can View"" beforeI actually give them the sharing optionSo I can type in another email...  Let's say""Lisa Elliot"", for the demonstration...  I'mgoing to choose: Lisa ""Can View""... Then press ""Share"".And of course, the user is required tosign in before accessing document.  That'sthat.  So when Lisa is available and whenshe accepts it her name will appearright here, with her avatar.  That's all regarding the ""Sharing"" demonstration.Now, I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.So we saw how to create a notebook.  Wesaw that it automatically saves andsyncs our notes as we work.  We can typeinformation anywhere and insert it fromother apps and web pages.  We can takehandwritten notes or draw our ideas.  Wecan use the highlighting and tags foreasy follow-up.  And we can share ourthe same items.  And if we do save ourmeans under our personal OneDrive or ourbusiness OneDrive, we can access thoseYou got it.  So taking notes in OneNote:You can take the notes the way you want.You can type them write them converthandwritten notes to text and evenrecord audio notes.  You can add picturesfiles and videos to your notes to createinteractive notebooks.  You can alsocreate as many pages and sections andthose notes to get them to look just theway you want.  And you can also apply abackground color to your OneNote pagesto change their appearance and make yourgoing to quickly backtrack and go on myOneNote...  And here you go...  Over here,under ""View"", on the ribbon, I can choose to add""Grid"" or maybe just the typical ""RuleLines"", smaller ones if I wanted...  And righton the left of it, the color page.  So ofcourse, those are extremely light...  Let'ssee...  Here you go.  I applied the backgroundcolor.  So there's a lot of things you cando with OneNote and this is why it's aneat application!  Let me backtrackagain to my PowerPoint presentation.  So Ican insert and format the table inOneNote to visually organize information.Let me go back to my OneNote.  This is theportion I left out...  We can go to the""Shopping List"" again, under ""Budget"" and inhere,  I can insert a table just like inWord or PowerPoint. I'm going to highlight4 columns and pick 3 rows... Then I'mgoing to expand the ""Birthday Shopping List""to remember the items I had to purchasefor my budget.  So ""Cake, ""Food"", ""Beverages"",""Activities""...  Let's say, for the ""Cake"": Iwanted to spend 85, the ""Food"": 150,""Beverages"": 80...  And then,""Activities"": 250...  I ended upspending only 50 for the ""Cake"", 125for the ""Food""... ""Beverages"": 100 and then forthe ""Activities"" I went all out: 350.  Nowbecause I inserted a table you willnotice I was on my ""Home"" page and it took me straight to the ""Layout"" tab, under ""Table Tools""...  And it'soffering to convert my table to an Excelspreadsheet...  So I'm going to click onthat.  It's now downloading the app:  TheExcel spreadsheet into OneNote app...  Andif I go to edit and I right-click, here.It has already launched the Excelspreadsheet; my data is included inthat spreadsheet...  And now I have theoption to go to ""Insert"" tab within Excel andadd a recommended chart, for instance...I'll just pick a basic one...  And when I dosave that spreadsheet, it willactually be saved within OneNote.  I'm goingto close this window.  Let's give it a fewseconds... This chart should appear inmy OneNote.Well, everything is slow this evening.All right.  So here it is.   I'm closing that.So now the chart has appeared within myOneNote.  And if I do again aright-click, my option here is to selectwhat to display...  And in there, I'm justgoing to uncheck: ""Display Everything"", ""Sheet1""...  And select just ""Chart1""...  So the ideahere for my budget is  that I want to see apretty chart in my OneNote...  And next year,I'll know how to handle my budget better.That was the last part of the exercise.I'm going back to my PowerPoint.  So youcan draw and sketch in OneNote to bringyour notes to life.  You can insert shapeslike a circle, triangle, or rectangle, oreven draw shapes with your finger, pen, ormouse, and OneNote will automaticallyclean them up for you.  You can share andstay organized in OneNote.  It can helpyou find notes no matter where they are.Whether you like a lot of structure, orjust a little, OneNote helps you organizeyour notebook exactly the way you want.You can share and sync in OneNote.  You canshare a page or your entire notebook tocollaborate with others.  You can usepasswords to protect notebook sectionsyou want to keep private.  You can set upyour mobile apps.  Use OneNote on iOS soyou can connect to and work with yourOneNote on your Android phone or tablet,your notes can go wherever you go.  Fromany browser on any device, easily signinto OneNote for the webso you always have access to your notes.And that'll be it for today.

148388,en,Creating Business Solutions with SalesTim,149.0,"In this video, we will see how to provide new Business Solutions for your company and all your employees.We will therefore create ready-to-use, pre-configured teams: a list of conversational channels, user guides and ""Planners"" with pre-defined tasks. All will be available in a catalog of solutions dedicated to your Company. With all this, you will be able to start working immediately.To illustrate this, I will use a concrete case where we will prepare a business solution to help salespersons collaborate to make a business proposal.In Microsoft Teams, I want to replicate this team which enables me to organize the creation of business proposals. This team includes defined channels on the different topics of conversation,tabs containing internal sites and a planner with the tasks to be performed for each business proposal.So, I'm going to create a new business solution from this team. To begin with, as an administrator, I go to the “Catalog” tab of SalesTimand access the list of Business Solutions available to the company, which I choose to enable or disable.To make a new business solution available, I select ""Create"".Then I choose the team that will be my template. I choose the team we talked about before.I then define the name of my business solution which will appear in the company catalog.  Then, the description that users will see and the elements I want to replicate: apps, tabs, settings, and if I want, members.Note that websites, tabs and planners will be pre-configured.I then choose the default name of all teams,I choose a naming convention.For example, here, I will add ""- Sales"" to distinguish all the teams created from this business solution.I If I want, I can do the same for the different elements like the emails, the descriptionand the welcome message.I choose whether or not to appoint an owner.I can look for an owner by name directly in the company directory.The owner will be notified of a new request by email and will have to validate or not the creation in the SalesTim application.I choose to set up audience targeting or not. We will see this in a second video.Then, I set the security setting; All these settings will be permanent.I choose whether I want the team to be private or public; if I choose “private”, all teams will be private and remain so. I add permanent owners or permanent members.In his case, I can add a legal person who must monitor sales as a permanent member. Finally, I determine the emails that are sent to owners: After the creation,one week later, two weeks later, to help them promote the adoption of this new business solution. I create the new template and make it available to my company.I then go to the homepage as an end-user,I choose to create a new team.I select the business solution,launch the creationand, a few seconds later, I discover the team with the list of channels,tabsand a ready-to-use planner.You can create an unlimited number of business solutions to meet all your company’s needs and use Microsoft Teams to be effective in your daily teamwork.You can create teams to manage projects, recruitments, sales, or even to structure your teams by department.",2019,N/A,[],['Salestim'],['Other Products'],252.0,tutorial
148389,en,"Advanced Configuration: Naming Convention, Audience and Security",42.0,"Now that you have seen how to set up Business Solutions in SalesTim, we will focus on advanced options. For example, you want to set up an advanced and differentiated naming convention depending on team templates.Or, you would like to appoint permanent members or owners for all teams created from a template. Or, you want to target the audience for which the team template is intended.We will see how to do this in this tutorial.As explained in the 1st tutorial, I create a new business solution.First of all, on the Naming Convention, I have the option to add a prefix, a suffix or any element of the user’s profile, the Azure AD profile.For example, I want to create a template for the sales department: in the naming convention, I want to indicate the country and the fact that this team is dedicated to the sales department. The country is displayed in the user profile so I will indicate it as an automatic value added to the creation. This will therefore include the country indicated in the user profile of the person making the request. I will then add at the end “- Sales Dep”to indicate that the profile is associated to the sales department. I can then do the same for all the elements, whether it is the description or the welcome message.This way, I can make sure that all the elements are created automatically and take all the requester’s information. If you wish to go further, you can refer to the documentation which indicates all the possibilities or contact us directly.This solution is only intended for sales departments. I would like to ensure that it appears only for people who have a sales function. Indeed, users in the operations or HR departments have no interest in seeing this. So, I go to the ""Audience Targeting"" section. I can thus set up from any data in a given user profile whether or not this business solution will be displayed. I enter here. I enter here the fact that this solution will only be available to users who have a sales function.To go further on audience targeting, you can refer to the documentation and/or contact us directly.Finally, about security, I want to make sure that all these teams are private and that the sales manager or someone from the IT management is a member of each created team linked with this template.I will therefore add them as permanent members by entering their first and last names.If this person changes position or leaves the company, I simply remove this person from the template and replace them with the new one.This new person will then be added to all the teams that were previously created from this template.I then save the business solution and make it available to users in the catalog.I create a new team with this solution,select it,enter the nameand then I find that the different elements are created automatically.I then start creating the teamand, a few minutes later, here I am with all the elements: a team with the right naming convention, owners and permanent members, the list of channels, tabs, etc.You have seen here a detailed example with a particular use case scenario about the sales department.The possibilities are unlimited!

Do you wonder how to facilitate the adoption and governance of Microsoft Teams for the different departments within your company? This is what SalesTim is all about.In order to enable effective teamwork around Microsoft Teams and make the best use of this application, on one hand it is essential to promote the adoption by all the different departments in your company. On the other hand, it is important to establish a defined framework to avoid the profusion of groups, sometimes in duplicate, resulting in a loss of efficiency and overinformation. This will inevitably put a break on adoption...Then, how can you get Microsoft Teams customized and adapted to your company's departments? How do you create team templates that meet your needs?How to help get familiar with teams created for users? How to ensure that teams are clearly organized? How to ensure satisfactory governance both for the businesses and the IT departments of the company? With SalesTim, you can create a catalog of Business Solutions in Microsoft Teams using team templates with their own levels of governance. Team templates include the list of channels, tabs, and pre-configured site and planner tabs. Simply create team templates that meet your needs: project management, response to a call for bids, recruitment management... The possibilities are endless and customizable! Set up a level of governance adapted to each of your templates and according to your needs: naming convention, an owner, permanent members... And much more! Everything is in your hands!To understand how the solution works, we will first experience it from the end-user's perspective, then from the administrator's point of view. To do this, we are now in the shoes of a Contoso project manager.SalesTim is an application in Microsoft Teams.In the homepage, I find all the teams of which I am a member.I can easily find a team thanks to the research tool.I want to create a new team to launch my project. I click on ""New team""and access the catalog of business solutions, which has been made available by the company.I then have the opportunity to create a team dedicated to the sales Department,to the HR Department or the management of new project. So, I choose this business solution.I enter the name of my project: Paris.A naming convention appears directly because the name of the team will be ""Paris - New Center"".I then make the request.Once the team is created the channels and information pushed by the company appear.For example, it could be a planner with a list of tasks already integrated.As a project manager all I have to do is assign them.You have seen how easy it is to have a created team ready to use and adapted to a specific business. We will see how to add a new business solution to the company's catalog. As an Office 365 administrator, I go to SalesTim in the catalog part and I create a new business solution.To do this, I select an existing team that will serve as a template. I then enter the name of the template,what I want to replicate between applications, tabs, etc. I then select which naming convention will be applied.I indicated I want an approver.I have the possibility to target the right audience. I then define whether the teams created from this template are private or public. I define members or permanent owners. Finally, I define the content of the email sent to the owners.That's it, the new business solution is available to my users.Thanks to SalesTim you have seen how easy it is to provide business solutions in Microsoft Teamsand to ensure the governance of the teams created.Thank you for following this introduction video and I suggest you to meet us right away in the video tutorial to learn more about SalesTim.",2019,N/A,[],[],[],318.0,use_case

The accountant is chasing me...- Oh, I see... but... don't you think she's pretty?- No, no, it's not what you think! She is after me because it's the end of the month and I still haven't sent her my expense form. It's always so complicated, I have to scan all my documents, send them to her, fill in an Excel sheet. I don't have time for that!Well, I guess you don't know about Office Lens! Let me show you how it works.Office Lens is a free application that you can link to your OneDrive account. I use it for my expense form. Forget about photocopiers and scanners.Once the application is downloaded and installed, I just take a picture of my tickets and receipts.Right, but centering a document is quite hard. Believe me, I already tried.Not so fast! With Lens there's no need to bother centering. The application does it on its own and look, I can even photograph several documents in a row.I will be able to collect all my receipts in a single PDF file.I will then save it in a OneDrive folder.So from OneDrive, I share this file with the accountant.She can, on her side, open the PDF and retrieve all the information she needs.In addition, Lens will automatically transcribe the text content of the photos, which allows it to copy and paste without risk of error.- Oh...
